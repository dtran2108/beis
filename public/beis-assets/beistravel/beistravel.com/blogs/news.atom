      <![CDATA[<p>Is there anything better than an adventure to someplace new? The people, the architecture, the culture—travel is pure bliss.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While life is often on pause during a vacation, the same can’t be said about fitness goals. Those never take a break. Thankfully, we know all about how to stay fit while traveling. And we’re here to share it with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready to go from jet-lag to <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/all-products/products/the-sport-duffle-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gym duffle bag?</a> Read on.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Do I Not Gain Weight While Traveling?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a question that many of us can relate to. With so much new food to try and so little time, gaining weight while traveling seems inevitable. That can feel doubly true if you don’t plan on straying far from the beach lounger. Coming back from a two-week trip with a few extra pounds isn’t unheard of—and we’re not talking about those souvenirs in your suitcase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are many ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle while traveling, and watching your weight doesn’t have to mean missing any of the fun activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve put together a list full of tips and tricks for all the health-conscious travelers out there.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Fitness Tips: Travel Edition</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grind doesn’t have to stop just because you’re on vacation. Whether you’re a fitness fanatic back home or you’re simply looking to counteract all those yummy carbs, here are our recommendations to help you workout while traveling.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Walk Everywhere</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is rule number one for staying fit on a trip. Have a reservation in another neighborhood? Walk there. Headed to a top tourist attraction? Again, walk there. Each mile you walk burns anywhere between 50 and 150 calories.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, there are times when walking doesn’t make sense. Some sites are simply too far away, and the lack of sidewalks and road rules in some destinations can make walking dangerous. But if you come prepared with a sturdy pair of shoes, a water bottle, and a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/all-products/products/the-convertible-mini-weekender-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chic bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all the essentials, you’re set to stroll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, walking is the best way to explore everyday life in a new city.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-beis-moves-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/BEIS_CTA3_35970fb1-a69b-4d10-975b-f74229fee3ba.png?v=1622295089" alt="For the everyday athlete. Shop now!" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Always Take the Stairs</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You thought walking ended at flat surfaces? Think again. Stairs are a fitness blessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skip the elevator in your hotel to really feel the burn. And instead of taking the cable car up to that lovely scenic vista, consider trekking up. You’ll save yourself some cash for an ice-cold drink at the top, and your legs will be a whole new level of toned. Besides, the view is always ten times better when you work for it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Seek Adventurous Activities</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those that don’t love the idea of working out but still want to stay fit, we have the solution for you: adventure sports. Nothing beats an activity that’s fun </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> burns calories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stunning landscapes of a new destination can suddenly become your playground. Whenever you visit somewhere new, research opportunities to try some of these exhilarating activities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rock climbing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayaking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paddleboarding</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downhill biking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surfing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White water rafting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skiing or snowboarding</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in major metropolitan areas, you’d be surprised how often you can find options like these nearby. Ask around at your hotel or homestay—they’ll gladly set you up with a day of adventure.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Exercise Like the Locals Do</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, you can always hit your hotel gym or fitness room if you need a quick workout. But where’s the adventure in that? To embrace a new culture fully, you should try everything the locals do. That includes exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in Vietnam, stop by an open-air gym by the waterfront. Grab your lederhosen and go hiking in the Alps. Visit the local gym in Peru to see everyday life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the simple, humbling experiences like these are the highlight of a trip.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Rent a Bike</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cities around the world become more and more eco-friendly, bike lanes are springing up everywhere. In locations like Amsterdam or Copenhagen, biking is more than just exercise—it’s a way of life. Hiring a two-wheeler to cruise around town for a day is an exciting way to see the sights </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">work that cardio.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Work Out in Your Room</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe it’s far too hot and humid outside. Maybe you’re on a business trip and don’t have much time to wander around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever your reason for staying in your room, there’s still plenty of opportunity for fitness. Clear a bit of space and put on a quick yoga video on YouTube. If you plan ahead, you can pack a jump rope or a resistance band in your bag. They hardly take up any space and can elevate a hotel room workout.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Stay_Fit_While_Traveling_-_Photo_1.jpg?v=1622064167" alt="Young woman doing stretches on a lake shore" style="float: none;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No workout gear? No problem. Calisthenics (also called bodyweight exercise) allow you to stay fit using nothing but your body. Here are some exercise ideas to create a fitness routine in a pinch:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push-ups</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squats</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sit-ups</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jumping jacks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burpees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tricep dips</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall sits</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Get Up Out of Your Seat</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picture this: you show up at the airport two hours before your flight (because you’re a savvy, responsible traveler). When you arrive, you see your takeoff has been delayed another two hours. Sounds like a lot of sitting and waiting at the gate, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong. Let’s get that heart rate pumping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any kind of trip—whether a quick stopover or long-term travel—inevitably involves waiting for some form of transportation. Use your time at the train or bus station to stand up and walk around—especially since you’ll be sitting down on the bus for hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to perform a complete workout routine in the airport security line. Some light stretching and a little stroll around is much better than sitting on a bench for hours before your flight.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Sleep Well</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know how hard it can be to crawl into bed when there’s so much of the world left to see. But staying fit on vacation is impossible without a good night’s sleep. Poor sleep is associated with higher body weight and a higher calorie intake.<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So make sure you get an adequate amount of sleep every night. Being well-rested at the start of each day will help you enjoy every moment. Plus, you’ll have enough energy left over after your walking tour for a quick stair climb or yoga class. If you’re looking for a new mat and you’re on the go, learn <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-choose-a-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to choose a yoga mat</a>. If you want to bring it with you, a <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-beis-moves-collection/products/the-travel-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel yoga mat</a> is perfect for this situation because you can easily throw it over your shoulder. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Eating and Drinking On a Trip</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food is one of life’s great pleasures, and eating your way through a new country is—to put it plainly—heavenly. But it can be easy to overindulge on vacation and throw any health goals to the wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food and drink consumption is as important to fitness as exercise. With that in mind, here’s how to be mindful of your eating habits while away.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Try Nutritious Alternatives</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you look at a country’s famous dishes, a lot of the time they can seem… well, unhealthy. Swiss cheese fondue, delicious (but greasy) Mexican street tacos, Canada’s gravy-smothered poutine—the list goes on. But look a little further, and you can find traditional meals that are authentic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Italy means bottomless pizza and pasta, but don’t forego a Caprese salad or a tomato-laden bruschetta, either. A trip to Greece is all about gyros and moussaka, yet nothing beats a garden-fresh Greek salad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this is to say that eating healthy food while traveling doesn’t mean avoiding traditional cuisine altogether. Do a little research on wholesome local foods before you leave, and you can dine out like a health-conscious queen.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Stay_Fit_While_Traveling_-_Photo_2.jpg?v=1622064238" alt="Healthy breakfast bowl full of fresh fruits" style="float: none;"></div>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Opt for Healthy Snacks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside of your daily meals, there are snacks. Every seasoned traveler knows that a well-packed </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags/products/the-backpack-in-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backpack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> full of snacks is the key to a pleasant train or ferry ride. But pre-packaged junk food tends to take over in this realm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when you go to pack your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags/products/the-rucksack-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">day bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> full of treats to nibble on, ditch the chips and chocolate bars. Instead, do your shopping at local markets when you can. Sample fresh fruit galore! Stock up on nuts and veggies! Make sure that you have the <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/20-gym-bag-essentials-for-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gym bag essentials for women</a> so you’ll never be hungry on a day trip again.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Watch the Alcohol</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s a gorgeous sunset in an exotic destination without the icy cocktail to go with it? Let’s face it: drinking and vacationing tend to go hand in hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s fun to imbibe on holiday, keep in mind that alcohol is not the most health-friendly. Alcohol temporarily stops your body from burning fat and beer and wine are full of empty calories.<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy your rooftop margarita, but try to keep it to one or two, and don’t give in to those late-night cravings for greasy, cheesy foods.</span></p>
<h3><strong>When in Rome...</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what they say. Sometimes you just have to do as the Romans do (which means eating a whole pizza to yourself). After all, part of the reason to travel is to experience new cultures. What better way to immerse yourself in a foreign country than by eating and drinking your way through it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything in moderation… including moderation! You’re somewhere new and exciting. Kick back and indulge a little every once in a while. The stairmaster will always be waiting for you tomorrow.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Staying Fit on the Fly</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you travel for business or pleasure, for one week or three months, you can maintain an active lifestyle and stay fit with these tips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave a little extra room in your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for some comfy sneakers and your workout clothes, and you’ll be ready for a fun, fitness-filled trip. As they say in Paris, bon voyage!</span></p>

Read all the tips here.</span><p><a class="read-more" href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/20-gym-bag-essentials-for-women">More</a></p>]]>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, more than 50% of all US gym members were women.&lt;sup&lt;2&lt; sup=""&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you’re one of them (or you’re planning to become one of them), you might be wondering what to pack in a gym bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, you’ve come to the right place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re a bonafide fitness fanatic or a bodybuilding beginner, you need these 20 gym bag essentials for women. Let’s get sweaty!</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Should You Pack in a Gym Bag?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some things in this life you simply cannot live without. When it comes to the gym, these 20 essentials should always be in your gym bag.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#1 Life Essentials</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe this should go without saying, but your phone, keys, and wallet are mandatory. They’re the things you likely never leave the house without. Even so, we’ve all ran out the front door in a rush and forgotten one of the three. Make sure you have these necessities with you before even thinking about hitting the gym.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#2 Water Bottle</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydration is everything when it comes to exercising. Realistically, you should have a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories/products/the-water-bottle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">water bottle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with you everywhere you go, and that goes double for the gym. Especially when you consider how many gyms are not offering water fountain services due to Covid-19 restrictions.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#3 Towels</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pack along a small quick-drying towel to use when you start sweating. Like, really sweating. You’ll be glad you did. If you plan to shower after your session, bring a full-sized towel as well (unless your gym has them available).</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-beis-moves-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/BEIS_CTA3_35970fb1-a69b-4d10-975b-f74229fee3ba.png?v=1622295089" alt="For the everyday athlete. Shop now!" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>#4 Gym Shoes</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe your gym sneakers match your outfit for the day. If so, great—you don’t even need to pack them—just wear them to the gym. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The odds are you’ll be sporting different shoes outside the gym, especially if you exercise before or after work or class. In which case, don’t forget to include your gym shoes in your bag. Light fabric or mesh shoes are best for the gym, as they’re lightweight, breathable, and don’t take up much room.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#5 Odor Remover</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one likes to admit it, so we’ll be the first: that gym bag, with all its shoes and towels, can get stinky real quick. If you’re a practicing yogi, learn <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-clean-your-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to clean your yoga mat</a>, to avoid unwanted odors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solve that by bringing an odor remover with you. Whether you use odor balls, a spray, or a powder, always carry something to eliminate the smell—especially if you store your <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/all-products/products/the-sport-duffle-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gym duffle bag</a> in your car or office.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#6 Hair Ties</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing you want on the treadmill is hair in your face. In fact, you don’t want that anywhere. If you were looking for a windblown supermodel hairstyle, you’d be on the catwalk, not the stairmaster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hair ties, bobby pins, and other hair accessories are your savior. Keep the hair out of your face, breathe, and focus on that next rep. You got this.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/20_Gym_Bag_Essentials_for_Women_-_Photo_1.jpg?v=1622065317" alt="Pretty women in gym relaxing on a roller" style="float: none;"></div>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>#7 Change of Clothes</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you go to the gym, you need two sets of clothes: one that you’ll wear when you exercise, and one that you’ll put on afterward. If you’re heading straight from home to the gym, you might wear your workout clothes there. In that case, bring some comfortable street clothes for after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re the type to do squats on your lunch break, you’ll probably want to keep the gym clothes in your bag and change when you get there. Above all, don’t forget the rule about two sets of clothes. No one likes the feeling of wearing dirty clothes after a workout.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#8 Clean Socks and Undergarments</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you pack your extra tops and bottoms, don’t forget to bring spare underwear, socks, and a bra as well. These are the pieces that see the most action, so to speak, so having fresh ones at the ready is a must.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#9 Smartwatch or Fitness Tracker</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your workout even count if your Fitbit didn’t track it? Okay, of course it does… but keeping track of your exercise is half the fun. Pack your smartwatch to monitor your steps and heart rate, or download an app on your phone to track your fitness milestones.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#10 Headphones</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A modern-day necessity. Whether you’re a podcast kind of girl or you want to blast the tunes, no solo trip to the gym is complete without headphones. To kick it up a notch, opt for wireless headphones, and never worry about a tangled mess of cables again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headphones are perfect for when you don’t feel like talking to strangers. And let’s face it—your gym playlist is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better than whatever they’ve been playing lately.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#11 Lock</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at all this awesome stuff in your gym bag. It’d be a shame if someone were to steal it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t even give them a chance! Always bring a gym lock with you, as most gyms provide free lockers for use during your workout. We recommend using a combination letter or number lock, so you don’t have to worry about hanging on to a key.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#12 Deodorant</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This one should be pretty self-explanatory. Choose your favorite deodorant or antiperspirant, and stash it in your gym bag. Put some on before your workout and again afterward.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#13 Face and Body Wipes</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes there’s no time for a shower post-workout. But that’s not a problem for you, because you brought face and body wipes. In a pinch, you can use these for a quick dry shower. Give yourself a once-over with a nice body wipe, and you’ll be fresh as a daisy until you find time for a good scrub.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#14 Shampoo and Conditioner</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have time to use those shower facilities, make sure you have all the essentials; soap, shampoo, conditioner, maybe a razor. Stow it all neatly in a hanging shower caddy, and you won’t have to worry about soaking the rest of your gym bag.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#15 Shower Shoes</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The showers at your gym may be nice, but they’re still public showers. Slip a pair of flip-flops or slides into your bag and keep your feet away from those tile floors. Nobody wants athlete’s foot.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#16 Makeup</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always take your makeup off before working out to avoid clogged pores and irritated eyes. If you have plans after the gym, you may want to reapply your mascara. Keep all your products together in a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories/products/the-cosmetic-pouch-set-in-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmetic Pouch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and you’ll never have to dig through your duffle again.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#17 Snacks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this exercise is hard work! If you build up an appetite during your routine, we recommend stashing a few protein bars or other snacks in your bag. They won’t replace a meal, but they’re perfect for a quick burst of energy post-workout snack.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/20_Gym_Bag_Essentials_for_Women_-_Photo_2.jpg?v=1622065371" alt="Young woman in the gym eating snack bar" style="float: none;"></div>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>#18 Protein Powder and Shaker</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein is essential to muscle growth and recovery after exercise.<sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For those of you that love protein powder, you won’t want to hit the gym without your shaker bottle and some good old whey or pea protein.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#19 Bathing Suit</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your fitness center has a pool, steam room, or sauna, be sure to take advantage of it! Don’t be caught without your bathing suit (and a swim cap, if that’s your style).</span></p>
<h3><strong>#20 Hairbrush</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tame that crazy gym hair with a handy hairbrush. Need we say any more?</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is the Best Gym Bag?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you know what you want to put </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inside</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your gym bag, it’s time to find the bag itself. The gym bag you choose will dictate what you’re able to bring with you for your workout. That means that the best gym bag is the one that carries everything you need, without breaking the bank or your back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the minimalist, there’s<a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/all-products/products/the-sport-pack-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Sport Tote Bag</a>. And let’s clear something up here: minimalism doesn’t mean a lack of storage space. This bag can carry your tennis racket or your yoga mat along with all the necessities, making it the perfect gym bag for just about anyone. Wear it as a backpack or a tote, depending on your mood. If you are looking for the perfect yoga equipment, make sure you know <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-choose-a-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to choose a yoga mat</a> for all of your needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re more of a traditional gym-goer, you can’t go wrong with a duffle bag. Introducing: The Sport Duffle. With zipper pockets galore and enough room to overpack, this bag was designed to fit perfectly in a gym locker. Too bad it looks so good that you’ll never want to hide it away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, look for a bag that is spacious (but not humongous), easy to carry, and neutral-colored to match with any outfit. And don’t forget the organizational pockets and pouches.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Organizing Your Gym Bag</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our tip for organizing your gym bag is simple: think about all the different moments of your gym experience, and group your things accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, there’s all the stuff you need before your workout (deodorant, gym membership, etc.). Keep those in an easily accessible pouch. Then, there’s your during-workout needs—your headphones, your towel, shoes, and so on. Have these in another section of your bag. Lastly, you have a post-workout portion. Compartmentalize your shower stuff and change of clothes so they’re ready to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can even use </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories/products/the-packing-cubes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing cubes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make the most of your gym bag’s space. Grabbing your “post-workout cube” and heading to the showers becomes a whole lot easier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfect gym bag? Check. The perfectly packed bag? Check. With BÉIS, you’re always ready for your next workout—whenever the mood strikes. </span></p>

      <![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for a yoga mat? With so many options out there, it can be difficult to know what to look for! We have all the answers for you here on our blog.</span><p><a class="read-more" href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-choose-a-yoga-mat">More</a></p>]]>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re reading this from your handstand or you’re still working to find your flow, your yoga mat should always have your back—not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in savasana. Between 2012 and 2016, the number of people practicing yoga in the United States grew by 50%.<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As this percentage continues to rise, so too do the number of yoga mats on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news: You’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sure</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find one that’s a great fit for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The not-so-good news: An abundance of choices can overwhelm even the most serene, level-headed yogi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not sure what to look for in a yoga mat? No problem. Consider this blog a guided, meditative walk through the essentials of yoga mat shopping. Here’s a look at a few stops you’ll be taking along the way: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga Mat Thickness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common Yoga Mat Materials</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Choose a Yoga Mat That’s Right for You</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Type of Mat is Best for my Preferred Yoga Practice?</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Yoga Mat Thickness</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When purchasing a new mat, one of the top considerations to make is thickness. You’ll be spending a lot of time here in several different poses, so you’ll want to make sure your feet, hands, knees, and every other extremity rooting you to the earth is being adequately cushioned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga mats generally come in three categories of thickness:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>1-3mm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The thinnest and most lightweight mat you’re likely to find on the market is one millimeter. Yoga mats between two and three millimeters are also considered to be on the slimmer side.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>4-5mm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Most standard yoga mats fall under this category of thickness. What’s standard for some might </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be for you. While this is often a good fit for most yogis, don’t be afraid to opt for something a bit different if that’s what your body needs! </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>6mm</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Finding anything more robust than six millimeters wouldn’t be very common. But if you’re looking for extra support, this should be enough to keep your joints comfortable. This thickness is also ideal when practicing on hard floors.</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Common Yoga Mat Materials</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Materials matter, especially when it comes to your yoga mat's durability, stickiness, cost, and cleanliness. If your mat is dirty, you might wonder <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-clean-your-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to clean your yoga mat</a>. Though a towel or blanket can save you when you’re in a pinch, you’ll want to find a mat material that’s going to be your partner-in-prana. Here’s a brief look at some materials you’re likely to come across in your search.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: As you go through this list, keep a mental note of what seem like top priorities for your practice.</span></i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>PVC</b><span> – Polyvinyl chloride is one of the most common, cost-effective, and sticky mats out there. The drawbacks? They’re non-recyclable and often made with toxic chemicals like phthalates (used to increase flexibility).<br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>TPE </b><span>– Thermoplastic elastomer. Another material whose name probably transports you back to high school chemistry class. These mats are rubbery, recyclable, and likely to retain their shape over time.<sup>2</sup><br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Natural Rubber</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Easy to clean, extra grippy, and a great alternative to other synthetic options. Beware of the odor, though! Don’t worry, it will improve with time. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe just break it in and air it out a few times first before bringing it to a yogi-packed class. <br><br></span></i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Jute</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – An easily biodegradable mat. Also, because of its plant origin, a jute mat helps keep air cleaner by absorbing carbon dioxide! Keep in mind, this mat could have a tendency to slide a bit on wooden or tile floors. <br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Cotton</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – What it lacks in stickiness, it makes up for in eco-friendliness and recyclability. Cotton mats are also machine washable and portable.<br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Wool</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Soft and snuggly, though not-at-all sticky. Yogis love this mat because of its low environmental impact. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’re a bit more oriented to the varying materials and thicknesses of most yoga mats, let’s find one that’s best suited to you. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Choose_a_Yoga_Mat_-_Photo_1.jpg?v=1622066076" alt="Woman folding a yoga mat" style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>How to Choose a Yoga Mat That’s Right for You </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An essential part of practicing yoga is finding what feels right for you and your body. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shopping</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a yoga mat adheres to a similar philosophy. What works for your yogi pal might not necessarily be best for you, and vice versa. In addition to considering what your body might benefit most from, keeping things like location, level of practice, and the environment in mind could help weed out a few mat mismatches. </span></p>
<h3><strong>For the Beginner Yogi</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re new to the practice, but you’re a bold beginner. You’re hoping to step onto the mat nearly every day, and you’re curious to try as many poses as your body allows. You’ll want a mat that supports your yoga dreams and your body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a yoga mat that is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sticky (to give you more confidence as you find your footing)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy-to-clean and durable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standard (4-5mm) thickness</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a humble beginner looking to ease into things with some slower, meditative practices, consider a soft wool or cotton textured mat to keep you cozy and relaxed. </span></p>
<h3><strong>For the Traveling Yogi</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re taking your practice to Bali, the park, or a yoga studio on the other side of the city, you need a yoga mat compatible with your on-the-go soul. At-home practices are great once in a while, but you much prefer to build your balance across the map. Consider a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-beis-moves-collection/products/the-travel-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-beis-moves-collection/products/the-travel-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">yoga mat</a> that is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightweight and a cooperative airplane companion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slim (1-3mm in thickness) to avoid weighing down your luggage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost-effective, so that you can spend more money on flights</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>For the Environmentally-Conscious Yogi</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were a yoga pose, you’d be a tree pose. You are the go-to friend when everyone has questions about recycling, and you’ve been practicing yoga since way before it was cool. You live a low-waste lifestyle, and keeping our earth safe is a top priority to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since sustainability is a non-negotiable for you, consider a yoga mat that is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Made with eco-friendly materials that can be recycled like wool, natural rubber, jute, wool, or cotton.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thicker (5-6mm), especially if you frequently take your practice to a root-filled forest. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>For the Advanced Yogi</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve come a long way in your practice, and you’re darn proud of it, too. You can’t imagine your life without yoga. You impress your friends with peacock poses, but mostly, you love encouraging them to get started on their own yoga journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re ready to retire your old one, consider a new yoga mat that is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinner (2-3mm) to keep you steadier in your balance practice</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extra sticky (you definitely don’t want to be sliding around the floor the next time you attempt a challenging pose)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durable</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoga, for you, is not going anywhere, and you want a mat that will stand the test of time alongside you. </span></p>
<h3><strong>For the Sensitive Yogi</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are grateful to have a practice that offers accessible modifications for you and your body. Whether you’re dealing with a chronic injury or simply have sensitive joints, you’ll want to have a gentle, forgiving space that meets you where you’re at. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a yoga mat that is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thick to extra-thick (4-6mm) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soft if you prefer a more mellow cushion yoga style</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sticky to keep you from moving around too much and aggravating an injury</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stickier, thicker mat should help make more poses available to you without sacrificing comfort or risking injury.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Choose_a_Yoga_Mat_-_Photo_2.jpg?v=1622066119" alt="Woman doing yoga on a blue mat" style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What Type of Mat is Best for my Preferred Yoga Practice? </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One last thing to consider when choosing a yoga mat is the type of yoga you most regularly practice in yoga class or if you're a yoga instructor. Hatha yoga, often ideal for beginners, doesn’t require anything too fancy. Any mat might work well with this practice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For yogis who prefer Bikram or Ashtanga practices, you’ll certainly want to keep that in mind when making your purchase. Since Bikram will likely have you sweating a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ton</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a mat that is easy to clean is second to none. Ashtanga is another lively practice that will require an extra sticky mat to keep you moving in between poses with more finesse. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Hop on the Mat With BÉIS</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At BÉIS, we like to keep things balanced. We’re professional packers, that’s true. But we’re also fellow yoga enthusiasts. So, what do you get when you combine the two?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most of our bags and travel accessories, it’s functional </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">super stylish. We think it could be the perfect companion for your next trip abroad or for practicing at home with your friends and fur babies if you want to take the step and learn <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-stay-fit-while-traveling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to stay fit while traveling</a>.

<h2><strong>How Often Should You Clean Your Yoga Mat?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be honest. When was the last time you cleaned your yoga mat? Whether it was months ago or just this morning, an extra wipe-down definitely won’t hurt. You should be sure to find one that’s a great fit for you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your best interest, make sure you can clean it easily when you are looking at <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-choose-a-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to choose a yoga mat</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to how often you should be cleaning your yoga mat, the short answer is that you should probably clean your yoga mat after every use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not talking about an hour-long bath, just a quick refresher as a preventative measure for germs and bacteria. Depending on your practice, you may not find that to be totally necessary. However, a quick cleanse after a sweaty Bikram session or a few chaturangas is something you might want to make this part of your routine. Not only will it help your yoga mat last longer, but it will keep unwanted odors and grime from building up and caking on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also consider adding a deep clean to the calendar once a month. Especially since it can minimize the possibility of unwanted </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nopes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin infections</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acne </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Toenail fungus<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-beis-moves-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/BEIS_CTA3_35970fb1-a69b-4d10-975b-f74229fee3ba.png?v=1622295089" alt="For the everyday athlete.

<h2><strong>How-To: The Quick Refresher</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, the quick refresh is all you need. It only takes a few minutes, and it goes a long way in preventing any sort of unwanted buildup. For that, we suggest concocting a homemade spray that is safe to use on your mat every day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what you’ll need:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spray bottle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witch hazel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential oil(s) of your choice</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, mix one-quarter of a cup of witch hazel with about three-quarters of a cup of water. Then, add two to three drops of your preferred essential oil, mix it up, and transfer to a spray bottle, or assemble the cleaning crew right in the bottle itself. Dampen a microfiber cloth with the mixture and wipe your mat a few times over. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few of the best antibacterial and antimicrobial essential oils to choose from:<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tea tree essential oil</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peppermint essential oil </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lavender essential oil</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cedarwood essential oil</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eucalyptus essential oil </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemongrass essential oil </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t have time for a DIY? Pick up an all-natural cleaning solution. Look for one that boasts an array of clean, easy-to-read ingredients and is appropriate for everyday use, too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can throw these oils into your <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/20-gym-bag-essentials-for-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gym bag essentials for women</a> for a quick refresh! </span></p>
<h2><strong>How-To: The Deep Clean</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re afraid your mat has built up a miniature mountain of sweat and bacteria, maybe you’re due for The Deep Clean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How often you need this approach really depends on how active you are on your mat. If you can only manage to squeeze in a few sessions a month, don’t worry </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> much if you skip this sanitizing step every so often. On the other hand, if you’re using, transporting, or (especially) sharing your mat, set a monthly reminder and stick to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this method, summon the following simple, deep-cleaning forces:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warm water</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dish soap</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baking soda</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential oils </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Deep Clean strategy looks a bit different depending on what kind of yoga mat you have. In this case, the material doesn’t matter quite as much as texture. Open-cell mats are more absorbent and porous, whereas closed-cell mats are not absorbent at all. Additionally, open-cell technology tends to be a bit more springy while closed-cell technology is more firm. So, before proceeding, be sure to know which technology you’re currently using. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Clean_Your_Yoga_Mat_-_Photo_1.jpg?v=1622066762" alt="Young man doing yoga in a beautiful spacious apartment" style="float: none;"></div>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>For Open Cell Mats:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Submerge it in a tub of warm water (just enough to cover the mat). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mix in a couple of tablespoons of your household dish soap.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add a sprinkle of baking soda or a couple of drops of essential oil if it’s extra grimy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave it to soak for a few minutes and scrub it down using a microfiber cloth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to thoroughly rinse off any extra soap and let it dry completely before putting it back in action. </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>For Closed-Cell Mats:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skip the submersion method as it could cause damage to your mat.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mix warm water with a tablespoon of dish soap.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add baking soda and essential oils, if desired.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot-clean the mat directly using a microfiber cloth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a clean cloth, wipe off any excess soap, and leave it out to dry completely. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Don’t Forget to Dry</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-washing part of the cleaning process must not be overlooked. We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again: be sure to let your clean yoga mat dry out completely before jumping back into your practice. Warm, moist mats can be a breeding ground for all sorts of bacteria—yes, the bacteria you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent time removing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid counteracting all of your hard work, practice some patience with a little meditation and let it dry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how you can dry your mat without harming the underlying material:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Air dry</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat down any excess moisture with a dry towel</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hang on a clothesline, although too much time in the sun may cause fading</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drape over the shower curtain road, or the back of a chair</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you do, don’t dry your yoga mat using the following methods:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tumble dry </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drying with a hairdryer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campfires or any other open flames are a no-no, too</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Frequently Asked Cleaning Questions</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we send you off on a cleaning frenzy, let’s address a couple of questions and concerns you yogis might have. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Clean_Your_Yoga_Mat_-_Photo_2.jpg?v=1622066823" alt="Woman cleaning gym gear with wipes" style="float: none;"></div>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Can I Use Clorox or Lysol Wipes on my Mat? </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are, there’s a container or two of Clorox or Lysol wipes in your cleaning cupboard. While these are the captains of cleaning countertops and other surfaces, they might not be ideal for your yoga mat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why not, you ask? They are disinfecting powerhouses because of the harsher ingredients lining each fiber. While not all use bleach, you’ll want to avoid any wipes containing ammonia, phosphates, solvents, and petroleum-based ingredients. These harsh chemicals can cause the yoga mat’s material to slowly erode over many washes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, having harsh cleaning chemicals around means that you always risk coming into contact with them. If you clean regularly, that means these chemicals can dry out and harm your skin. Additionally, if you have curious little ones (or furry ones) who tend to put any loose item into their mouths, you’d rather your yoga mat be cleaned with safe, non-toxic alternatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you must use them, consider giving your mat a post-bath bath with mild soap and water to wipe away any unwanted chemicals. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Can I Machine-Wash my Yoga Mat?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re trying to cut some cleaning corners, you may have considered the possibility of machine-washing your mat. Work smarter, not harder, right? While we like how you think, it may not be the best option for all types of yoga mats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some mats are, in fact, machine washable. You’ll want to double-check with your yoga mat brand and its cleaning guidelines to be sure. Either way, it should probably be done sparingly if you want to increase your mat’s overall lifespan. Sticking with a more hands-on approach is likely the safer option. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Should I Use a Yoga Mat Cover or Towel?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a yoga mat cover or towel can help keep your yoga mat cleaner than posing directly atop it, this doesn’t mean you should forgo the cleaning process altogether. Additionally, some find that a yoga mat cover makes their yoga experience a bit more slippery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When in doubt, try it out. You may find that a yoga towel cuts down on the number of times you deep clean and bolsters your yoga practice.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Share Yoga Sessions, Not Germs</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From downward dog to pigeon pose, you usually come to your yoga mat seeking peace and relaxation. The opposite effect might occur if you spiral downward into a fungi-infused panic about what could be living on your place of practice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as you commit to showing up on the mat every day, commit to keeping it clean, too. We’re hoping these tips will keep your beloved, flat-lying companion germ-free. A safe, sanitary spot for you to continue your practice is just as important as the practice itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried your mat has reached the point of no return, consider replacing it with our new <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-beis-moves-collection/products/the-travel-yoga-mat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel yoga mat</a> and start your cleaning regimen afresh.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nama-stay clean, yogis.</span></p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dopp kit is a portable, versatile bag that houses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories">travel </a><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessories</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you may need on a long journey, from lotions and creams to hairbrushes and razors. Generally, it’s relatively small, with a squared base and zippered top, and it’s able to fit into the very last crevices of a fully packed suitcase or travel bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how did the Dopp kit come to be? And what does Dopp kit mean?</span></p>
<br>
<h2><strong>Dopp Kit 101: A Brief History in Toiletry Cases</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s travel back to early 20th century Germany to visit a man named Charles </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dopp</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">elt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Doppelt was a German leather-smith who later migrated to the United States. Perhaps inspired by his journey, Doppelt unveiled his leather-laden, waterproof toiletry case in 1926, alongside a line of Dopp-Bilt leather business briefcases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the second world war commenced, Dopp kits were introduced to the military, providing millions of bags to soldiers overseas.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The toiletry cases became a hit and were adopted by much of America following the war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term Dopp kit soon became a signature alternative to the phrase toilet bag—a terminology disliked by many Americans at the time due to its “dirty” connotation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so the Dopp kit was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Dopp kits are used by men and women alike. Travelers and commuters alike never lacked for anything ever again—well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that isn’t entirely true. But one thing is for certain, Dopp kits provide an organizational haven for your much-needed toiletries and grooming essentials. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Dopp_kit_2.jpg?v=1620135512" alt="Smiling woman laying on a bed next to half packed dopp kit bag" style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Is a Dopp Kit the Same Thing as a Cosmetic Case?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, no. A Dopp kit is much smaller than a cosmetic case and provides more organization too. In other words, a Dopp kit is a travel toiletry bag for your essentials—toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor blades, hairbrushes, and deodorant. Basically, a Dopp kit holds anything you deem essential for your morning and nightly routines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s another way to think about Dopp kits. In the event of a lost suitcase, what would you want in your carry-on during a cross-country trip? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what you put in your Dopp kit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Dopp kit </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Most Dopp kits are made from leather, vinyl, polyester, or cloth and have an organization component as well. </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/beis-dopp-kit-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÉIS wire-framed Dopp kits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feature two interior pockets, as well as two zipped pockets for secured storage. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Cosmetic case </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Cosmetic cases, on the other hand, are for cosmetics—eyeshadow, lipstick, that silky mascara you indulged in that makes your eyelashes look </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">extra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> long. They’re relatively larger than Dopp kits, too—more rectangular in size than cylindrical like a Dopp kit. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of cosmetic cases as the surplus you typically store in checked <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luggage</a>. Similarly, a cosmetic bag may also hold a few organizational compartments to store small</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">er</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> items such as makeup brushes or foundation tubes. Some cosmetic cases even feature internal, clear pouches that allow for easy viewing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, both Dopp kits and cosmetic bags provide secured, zippered storage ideal for travel, both near and far. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/2_0a993aa4-416e-463b-a4e6-f9bd6a7daf06.png?v=1623324292" alt="shop luggage" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>How to Use a Dopp Kit</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about Dopp kits is that they’re extremely versatile, befitting numerous occasions and going-outs. They’re also a great travel option if you’re looking to maximize your space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what exactly are Dopp kits used for? Well, besides the essentials, anything you desire!</span></p>
<h3><strong>...As a Carry-On</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, Dopp kits provide great carry-on storage for planes, trains, and automobiles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re flying, pack your Dopp kit with each of your TSA-regulated liquids and gels for easy access while you scramble through the security check line. With one shoe off, another on, and suitcases in tow, you’ll no doubt thank Charles Doppelt once you cross the metal detector’s threshold and gain a nod of approval from the agent behind the screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dopp kits also serve as a great deterrent to overpacking of personal items! While it’s tempting to pack an arsenal of beauty products, skincare creams, and hair styling tools, it’s not optimal for quick weekend travel. Pull a Marie Kondo and bring only what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">brings you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joy—just maybe not that sparkly purple lipstick you love so much, you’ve got teeth to brush after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When flying, it may be useful to pack your Dopp kit with the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dental hygiene supplies such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, and mouthwash (to refresh after a long flight)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skin care items such as facial wipes or face wash (especially if your flight is overnight or transatlantic)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any daily medications you may need (or pain relief products like Advil)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapstick and facial moisturizer (low humidity levels in airplanes may cause skin dryness and discomfort)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand sanitizer (stay safe and germ-free with a travel-sized cleanser)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>...As a Gym Bag</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, the gym. The sanctum for sweat-suffused running equipment, otherworldly grunts (how’d an Orc get in?), and the Dopp kit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve climbed, you’ve run, you’ve yoga-ed. Now all that’s left is that refreshing after-workout shower. The small size of a Dopp kit makes it easy to store in a gym bag or purse, and offers the perfect locale to stash any cleaning supplies you may need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pack your gym-destined Dopp kit with the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shower essentials such as shampoo, conditioner,, and facial soap (or dry shampoo if you don’t plan on wetting your hair)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deodorant (your scent of choice, of course)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleansing wipes (to wipe down yourself and the machine after an especially arduous workout)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any shaving supplies, including razor blades and shaving cream</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dopp kit may even be a great place to store a wallet or keys for extra security</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>...For a Night Out</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s a romantic date night with your significant other or a rambunctious night out with friends, a Dopp kit is a great night-on-the-town companion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This occasion, perhaps, is when the use of a cosmetic case and a Dopp kit collide. A Dopp kit provides a compact space to store any date-night essentials, including mascara, blush, foundation, and makeup removing wipes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, it may even make a great (if not avant-garde) clutch! </span></p>
<h3><strong>...For a Midday Hike</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sun is out and so are you—trekking along a picturesque hiking path when suddenly you feel the emergence of a sun-blared burn. You reach into your backpack and pull out your handy Dopp kit—full of your hiking essentials, of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dopp kits are also a great storage space when on outdoor expeditions, holding sunscreen, chapstick, and maybe even a few granola bars. They’ll fit snugly into your backpack or large winter coat—that is, if you’re one to traverse along snow-laden hiking paths.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Find a Quality Dopp Kit</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’re convinced. The Dopp kit is the storage vessel for you. But what features should you look for when picking out your very own?</span></p>
<p><strong>Structure</strong> – The most coveted feature of a Dopp kit is its structure. Typically, Dopp kits are cultivated with tough exterior materials like leather, nylon, and polyester to uphold its shape. <br><br>Look for a Dopp kit that will last. At BÉIS, our Dopp kits are cultivated with a medley of polyester, vinyl-coated polyester (PVU), and polyurethane (PU)—a woven textile material made from polymer resins that give the bag waterproof qualities. <br><br><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Because Dopp kits may hold a variety of liquids and creams, there’s bound to be a few leaks or messes, especially in the case of air travel. <br><br>The waterproof lining material of Dopp kits not only prevents lotions and potions from leaking into suitcases and purses, but also allows for quick and easy clean-ups within the bag itself—simply water down a paper towel or rag, wipe up the liquid, and trek on. <br><br><b>Design</b><span> – Choose a Dopp kit that’s contemporary and uncomplicated. Too many pockets can get confusing, and while a banana-based pattern may tickle your fancy today, a simple design may suit you better in the long-run. <br></span><br>That’s why BÉIS offers four basic pastel colors—black, beige, Sakura pink, and matcha green— that’ll keep you stylishly chic for years to come.  <br><br><b>Portability</b><span> – You’ll want a bag that’s lightweight and compact. Extra appendages, such as adjustable loop handles may be useful as well, especially if you’re trying to make up for small counter spaces or avoid placing your bag on public surfaces.<br></span><br>The portability of Dopp kits is exactly why you can take them on everything from plane rides to date nights. It’s versatility, convenience, and on-to-go-ness all wrapped up into one accessible pouch.<br><br>Finally, if looking stylish while you’re traveling is an important factor for you, then you should also think about the brand…</p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Traveling to a location where the sights, scents, and sounds are all completely new is an adventure. Preparing for your travels, however, feels more like a circus show especially when you’re getting your <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel toiletry bag</a> organized. Before you get to enjoy all the delights of travel, you first have to juggle the stressors of packing, planning, and pouring over all the details that can lead to pre trip anxiety.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll help you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tame the lion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of travel anxiety. With a few relaxation tips and tricks, you can make it to your next destination with all the graceful ease of a trapeze artist, even if you are an anxious traveler.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<h2><strong>First, What is Travel Anxiety?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel excessive stress, fear or nervousness before embarking on any kind of travel, you might have travel anxiety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this sound like you? Even after you’ve checked to make sure you’ve packed your passport (seven times), you still wake up in a cold sweat the night before your upcoming trip, certain you’ve forgotten it. Or, you might have trouble getting any sleep </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the week before a journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, difficulty sleeping isn’t the only sign of travel anxiety. Other common symptoms of pre travel anxiety may include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortness of breath</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chest pain or rapid heart rate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nausea</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diarrhea </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreased focus and concentration</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s possible you’ve been plagued by travel anxiety for years without realizing it. Or maybe it’s only hitting you now as you embark on some new adventures and go out of your comfort zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step after recognizing your travel anxiety? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinpointing the source of your travel related anxiety and then using specific calming tricks to alleviate the symptoms.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/2_0a993aa4-416e-463b-a4e6-f9bd6a7daf06.png?v=1623324292" alt="shop luggage" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Three Sources of Travel Anxiety</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to traveling, there are three main areas of stress that are typical and widespread. Those include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Pre-Departure Doom and Gloom</strong> – You leave in a week, and you’ve made lists upon lists upon lists. So, why are you still feeling like something is missing? Before you even head to the airport, this is where decision fatigue can settle in. Not only do you have to decide on which flight to take, which seat to grab, where you’re going to stay, and what you’re going to pack, but you have to balance all these responsibilities alongside daily life.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>In-Transit Turbulence during Air Travel</strong> – Place your seat in the upright position and prepare for takeoff. For a lot of travelers, the idea of sitting in the plane is nerve-wracking. After all, for us non-aeronautical engineers, how the <i>heck</i> is this two-ton metal machine supposed to fly through the air? Take a deep breath; this in-transit turbulence can be a source of travel anxiety you can beat.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Post-Touchdown Terror </strong>– Maybe you read the first two descriptions and couldn’t relate. So, where is your travel anxiety coming from? Remember those new sights, new sounds, and new smells? With this newness comes a sense of being lost and alone. If your stress stems from post-touchdown worst case scenarios, then there are some specific calming tricks for you.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one of these categories matches your anxiety (or a combination of all three), then good—the first step is identifying where the source of stress is. Let’s talk about specific calming techniques for each situation. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Relaxation Tips For Pre-Departure Doom and Gloom</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a two-week vacation should be a breeze, right? Surprisingly, it’s never that simple. And the weeks leading up to your globetrotting adventure are often the most formidable. To that end, here are some relaxation and calming tips if you find yourself stressed before the airport.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Traveling abroad? Research the basics beforehand </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– If you’re planning on traveling to another country that speaks a different language or has unique cultural norms, then now is the time to prepare yourself emotionally. Learning even a few words of the language you’re about to immerse yourself in is a good start. Also, consider comparing culinary, communication, and clothing norms, too, so you’re not caught off guard by an unfamiliar gesture or embarrassed by any social faux pas. <br><br></span></span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Pack_like_a_pro.jpg?v=1620133747" alt="Sliling woman lying on a bed in he middle of packing" style="float: none;"></div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Pack like a pro with BÉIS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – When the quality of your trip depends on your thoroughness of packing, packing itself can become a major source of stress. What can help with this? Having the right tools. Whether you need a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-weekender-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compact bag for a weekend trip</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a travel toiletry bag, a dopp kit, or a heavy duty </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">luggage set</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a month-long work trip—BÉIS can help you travel in style. We have everything you need to keep your belongings safe, secure, and dry, no matter the destination. If you're wondering, “<a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/what-is-a-dopp-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is a dopp kit?</a>”, we’ve got you covered. Check out our blog for more information.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Cue the crew</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Especially if you’re traveling alone, be sure to let at least a couple of friends or family members know where you’ll be. Knowing that someone is looking out for you while you travel can be a destressor in and of itself. Additionally, if you’re worried about forgetting an item, ask that friend or family member to come over for coffee and pack with you. You can share a laugh, while ensuring you didn’t miss a single detail</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Treat yourself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – When you’re aware of what brings you stress or severe anxiety, you can actively take steps and develop coping skills to combat it. If you’re struggling to shake the nerves, remember that you can pause, step back, and treat yourself to a night of relaxation. Between booking hotels and packing the right amount of underwear, it can be incredibly helpful to treat you rself to a spa day. When at home, order in, turn the heat high on the bath, light a few candles—whatever you need to destress, do it. The to-do list will still be there after you’ve taken a few deep, refreshing breaths.</span>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Relaxation Tips For In-Transit Turbulence </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You made it. The packing, the planning, the pouring over details—that’s all in the past. Now it’s time to look ahead to the adventure and learn how to get over travel anxiety. But if the thought of flying over miles of the Atlantic has your nerves frayed, then it’s hard to enjoy the moment. Don't worry, you're not alone! Many people have a specific phobia of turbulence and have trouble staying calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When coping with in-transit stress, be sure to employ a few calming tricks and relaxation techniques:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Books or audiobooks </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– As long as reading while in motion doesn’t make you queasy, consider bringing along a book for the flight or train. Whether it’s a Spanish phrasebook or the cheesy romance novel you can’t put down, reading is a great way to distract from the hours-long journey ahead. Plus, you’ll get to visit a world outside your own—one that doesn’t take place on a plane. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Girl, put your records on</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Close your eyes and pop on your easy-like-Sunday-morning playlist. Calming tunes or your favorite podcast might help you breathe a little easier en route to your destination. Maybe just skip the true crime shows, for now. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Three words: </b><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-seatback-organizer-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Seatback Organizer</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Keep all your essential travel documents and travel necessities within reach with The BÉIS Seatback Organizer. You’ll enjoy the slip pockets on the inside, which keep all your chargers tangle-free and easy-to-locate. No more scrounging through bag after bag to locate your passport.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Relaxation Tips For Post-Touchdown Terror </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can almost taste the tapas now. But perhaps reality has also just set in: you have no clue where you are. Don’t fret just yet. The Mediterranean sunshine is nearly kissing your shoulders. Take these last few tips to the streets to ensure an easier transition post-travel:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Cue the crew (...again) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– You probably recognize this one from the pre-traveling tips. Family and friend support applies here as well! Having loved ones to call upon to help you navigate your new location through Google Maps, or having them to call upon when you’re missing home can make or break a trip. Sometimes, you just need a reminder of love to reorient you to the great adventure that awaits.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Plan a refresh once you land </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– We realize this might sound obvious, but you’d be surprised how often this simple suggestion is overlooked. A shower, a nap, and a quick reset once you land at your destination can do wonders for your entire trip. There’s no need to rush into every exciting activity. Remember that traveling is an opportunity—one best enjoyed well-rested and fresh. Ensure you have all your necessities handy with a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-dopp-kit-in-matcha-green?_pos=3&amp;_sid=f790c6dd3&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">water-resistant Dopp kit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Have a few must-sees, but don’t overbook yourself </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Touring a new place can quickly become overwhelming if you have a museum tour booked on one side of town and a dinner scheduled on the other. There will be some must-sees in every city, but don’t forget that flexibility in your schedule can spark spontaneity—who knows where the night will take you! </span>
</li>
</ul>

      <![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever wondered if packing cubes are worth it? In this blog, learn what packing cubes are and how they can help you pack for your next adventure!</span><p><a class="read-more" href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-use-packing-cubes">More</a></p>]]>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>Packing for a trip can go one of two ways. If you’re a meticulous packer, you may make a detailed packing list before carefully loading your belongings into your suitcase. If you’re a little more laissez-faire, you may toss everything in at the last minute, unbothered by said packing space and call it a day. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter which method you gravitate toward, there’s a decent chance that your stuff will get jumbled around during your travels. That’s where </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-packing-cubes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing cubes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> come in handy. These revolutionary tools and packing tips can help you pack your suitcase more efficiently and offer you unparalleled organization during your trip. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> packing cubes and how do they work? Below, we’ll break it all down for you.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Are Packing Cubes?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, packing cubes are small fabric pouches with zip closures. You can think of them like dresser drawers for your luggage. Rather than tossing everything into one big dark pit (i.e. your suitcase), a travel packing cube allows you to enjoy a little more organization when packing a bag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can use packing cubes to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group certain outfits together </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pack different clothing categories together (like pants, shirts, undergarments, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separate clean clothes from dirty clothes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have one designated compartment for your toiletries, electronics, etc. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all of your belongings strategically placed in convenient compartments, you’ll have a much easier time finding what you need on your trip. As a result, many packing cube aficionados swear by them. They are well worth the small investment, especially if you choose a durable brand. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/3_ef142f9f-4516-49eb-aaf2-da7369103eb8.png?v=1623324699" alt="shop luggage accessories Blog 4" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>How to Find the Best Packing Cubes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different brands of packing cubes on the market. Each one boasts different features and degrees of quality depending on <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/types-of-luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">types of luggage</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing cubes come with the following features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Stiff, durable fabric</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you’re an avid traveler, you want your travel cubes to last for a long time. Choosing a brand that uses durable fabric can make all the difference. A stiff, durable packing cube will hold its shape and keep your items contained. You won’t need to worry about it tearing, ripping, or becoming misshapen after a few uses.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Strong zippers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Similarly, high-quality packing cubes should come with strong zippers. This way, they will be able to withstand the pressure of containing your clothing and other items for years to come. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>A mesh opening </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– By choosing mesh packing cubes, you’ll be able to see exactly what’s inside at a glance. In turn, you won’t need to unpack your entire suitcase or rummage through each packing cube to find your favorite bikini, a clean pair of socks, or whatever else you’re looking for. You’ll be able to pinpoint the right packing cube in a matter of seconds. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Labels </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Some types of packing cubes come with handy labels on the outside. These labels can take your organization up a notch. By clearly labeling each packing cube, you can find what you need faster, whether it’s your glamorous dinner outfit, your beach day supplies, or some comfy athleisure wear. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Handles </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Handles are another helpful packing cube feature you don’t want to miss out on. Packing cubes with handles are much easier to take out of your luggage. Rather than scooping up your chosen packing cube, you can conveniently grab it by its handle instead. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>A selection of sizes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Packing cubes are available in a wide range of sizes. A large packing cube can be big enough to hold your thick winter coats, while a small packing cube is compact enough to contain your tiny toiletries. The best packing cube size is a matter of personal preference. However, it’s nice to have a few different sizes to mix and match with your various belongings.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for high-quality packing cubes with all of these helpful features, look no further than </span><a href="https://beistravel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÉIS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h2><strong>The Many Advantages of Using Packing Cubes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, you may be wondering, “Are packing cubes worth it?” According to many avid travelers, they certainly are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the advantages you can look forward to once you start using packing cubes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>A more efficient packing experience </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– While planning a vacation is an exciting endeavor, packing for one can be a challenge. If you’re wondering how to pack a suitcase efficiently, packing cubes can make all the difference. They give you clear compartments for each of your items and help you save the most space in your suitcase.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Better use of your luggage space</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Speaking of saving space, packing cubes help you do this by compressing your clothing down to a smaller volume. As a result, you can pack more without needing to size up your suitcase. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>An easier time finding things on your trip </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Since packing cubes serve as dresser drawers for your luggage, you won’t need to unpack everything when you get to your final destination if you don’t want to. Instead, you can simply pull items from your packing cubes as needed. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>A way to separate dirty and clean clothes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If your next adventure doesn’t involve a washing machine, chances are you’ll have a growing collection of dirty clothes to drag around with you. Rather than letting them mix in with your clean clothes, you can tuck them away conveniently in a designated dirty clothes packing cube. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>More privacy </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– When you travel, you often have to submit your luggage for inspection. While this is necessary for security reasons, it’s not always fun to think about a TSA agent rummaging through your underwear. By keeping your items stowed away in packing cubes, you can enjoy a little more privacy.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Less likelihood of overpacking </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Roughly 60% of people admit to being chronic overpackers.<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you’re one of them, you’re certainly not alone. When you’re under pressure to pack everything you need, it’s easy to get carried away with the packing process and toss in some unnecessary items at the end. This can temporarily reduce your packing anxiety, but it may also cost you a ton of money in oversize fees. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than stuffing your bag with everything besides the kitchen sink, use packing cubes to help you strategize and plan ahead. You can give each packing cube a purpose and pack it with intention. In turn, you’ll feel more confident that you packed everything you need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using packing cubes can level up your travel organization tenfold. Once you get used to the perks of packing cubes, you’ll never want to go back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lot like setting up a dresser in a new house after living with all of your clothes on the ground for a few days—the new and improved organization makes your life a lot easier! </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/packing_cubes_0002_Layer_3_769x1153_crop_center_b86cb757-3c94-46c1-9d16-0098663f7219_480x480.jpg?v=1616093964" alt=""></div>

<h2><strong>More Ways to Use Packing Cubes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packing cubes can transform your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but that’s not the only thing they’re good for. They have many useful applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you can use your packing cubes to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamline your linen closet</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Store your off-season clothing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organize your child’s toy room</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplify your <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-diaper-bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diaper bag backpack</a></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spruce up your craft room or home office</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizational options for packing cubes are truly endless. </span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Use Packing Cubes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part about packing cubes is that they’re super easy to use. All you have to do is open one up and place your stuff inside. As you zip the packing cube closed, try to squeeze out any excess air. This will help you compress your belongings down in size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your packing cubes have a slot for labels, make sure to label them as soon as you can so you don’t forget what’s inside. Your future self will thank you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’re done packing, position your collection of packing cubes strategically in your suitcase. If you’re doing it right, it will feel like a game of Tetris. By packing each cube close together, you can use up every inch of your suitcase, duffel bag, or carry-on bag.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Should You Roll Clothes in Packing Cubes?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, rolling your clothes is the best way to keep them wrinkle-free as you travel. Rolling them will also help them fit comfortably in your packing cubes.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Pack Like a Pro with BÉIS</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packing cubes are a simple yet powerful organizational tool that can streamline the packing process significantly. With their help, you can rest easy knowing that everything will be in perfect order the next time you unzip your bag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can help you spend</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less time </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rummaging through your suitcase and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enjoying your adventure. </span></p>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re an avid traveler or you enjoy the occasional weekend getaway, you need a reliable set of luggage bags. Not all types of luggage are built the same; each one offers a different degree of durability, functionality, and style. By choosing the right type of </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your needs, you can make your travel days a lot easier and more comfortable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we’ve broken down the different types of luggage by their styles, features, and sizes so you can choose the one that’s right for you.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Most Common Types of Luggage</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the most popular luggage options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Rolling suitcases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The standard rolling suitcase is many people’s go-to piece of luggage. It’s spacious, functional, and easy to take from place to place. Since rolling luggage is on wheels, you can easily glide it through airports and down long hotel hallways. Rolling suitcases come in a range of sizes, materials, and styles, giving you plenty of options to choose from. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Backpacks </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– If you pack on the lighter side, a <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backpack</a> may be your perfect carry-on bag. Due to its hands-free style, you can carry your Starbucks latte and bag of duty-free goodies with ease. If you’re nervous that a backpack may strain your shoulders, simply choose one with comfortable padded back straps.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Duffel bags </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A Duffel bag offers the space of a suitcase and the soft shape of a backpack. They’re easy to fit into overhead compartments and can hold unconventionally-shaped items. Some duffel bags also come with wheels and retractable handles, turning them into a hybrid suitcase. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Hard Luggage vs Soft Luggage</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to purchase a rolling suitcase, you have an important decision to make: </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/hard-vs-soft-luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardside or softside</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardside luggage is made of a hard material, like aluminum or polycarbonate, while softside luggage is made of fabric. Both types of suitcases offer unique advantages. </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Benefits of Hardside Luggage</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardside luggage stands out for its:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Durability </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Hardside luggage offers unparalleled durability. It will never rip or tear on you. Since it’s harder to overstuff, you’ll also be much less likely to damage its zippers.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Weather-resistance</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If your adventures take you through wet weather conditions, hardside luggage is the way to go. Due to its impermeable exterior, it can withstand snow, rain, and hail much better than its softside counterpart. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Cleanliness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Hardside luggage is super easy to clean. You can wipe it down with a damp cloth or antiseptic wipe at any time. If you’re a germaphobe, this can offer you a lot of relief. Due to its hard exterior, it also won’t absorb any liquids or mildew-aromas. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Protection</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you need to transport fragile items, a hardside suitcase can offer them more protection. Its hard outer shell will safeguard your valuables from anything that might bang up against them at the bottom of the plane. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" title="travel luggage"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/5.png?v=1617295096" alt="" style="float: none;" width="482" height="241"></a></div>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>The Benefits of Softside Luggage</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to hardside luggage, softside luggage offers more:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Accessibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you need to grab something from your suitcase in a pinch, softside luggage is easier to squeeze your hand into without opening the luggage completely. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Flexibility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you want the freedom to overpack a few items here and there, softside luggage is much more flexible, though overstuffing could cause issues with its zippers.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your priorities, one of these types of luggage will appeal to you more than the other. At BÉIS, we believe that hardside luggage takes the cake. That’s why we offer a line of </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardside luggage sets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made of super-durable polycarbonate. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Two-Wheeled vs Spinner Suitcases</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping for a suitcase, you have another important choice to make: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want two static wheels or four spinner wheels? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wheels you choose can make or break your travel experience. If they’re flimsy or hard to control, your travel day will be filled with frustration. When they glide smoothly and sturdily, your travel experience will follow suit.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Two-wheeled static suitcases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Two-wheeled luggage has been around for a long time. You’ve probably used it before. It rolls forward and backward and you have to tilt it back to get it moving. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the wheels only move in two directions, they’re a little easier to control on uneven surfaces. However, they can become burdensome if your bag is heavy, since you’ll always have to lean your suitcase back to drag it behind you. If your suitcase is super-heavy, this can put a great strain on your wrist and shoulders.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Four-wheeled spinner suitcases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Four-wheeled spinner suitcases have a much greater range of motion. Their wheels can rotate 360 degrees, enabling you to turn and spin your suitcase in any direction. With four wheels supporting your bag, you can glide it in an upright position as you walk through the airport or hotel lobby, taking all of the weight off your wrists and shoulders. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, it’s the favored option for most people and the type of suitcase we carry at BÉIS.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Different Luggage Sizes</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your next getaway’s length and occasion, you’ll need to choose a suitcase of adequate size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most luggage lines come with the following options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Carry-on bag </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– If you’re a light packer or if you don’t want to wait around at the baggage claim, you need a carry-on bag. Most airlines only allow carry-on bags that are 22 by 14 by 9 inches or smaller.<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At BÉIS, our carry-on bag is 21 inches tall, so you can trust that it will fit into the overhead bin with ease.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Medium check-in bag </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– If you need a little more space, you may be willing to check in your bag instead. At BÉIS, our medium-sized check-in bag is 26 inches tall. It offers the perfect amount of space to comfortably pack for a weeklong vacation. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Large check-in bag</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you want to check in a larger piece of luggage, 29 inches is a great size. This larger bag will offer you the extra room you need to pack bulky items or to bring more clothes for a longer travel excursion.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At BÉIS, you can get all three sizes in our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardside luggage set</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In turn, you’ll always have the size of suitcase you need on hand. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Types_of_Luggage_copy_img1.jpg?v=1614801211" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>The Most Important Luggage Features</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to choosing the right style, size, and wheels for your luggage, you should also look for some added features that can make your life easier, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Weight indicators</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – After packing your bag to the brim, you may be concerned about its weight. Will it exceed that 50-pound weight limit?<sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out, you can lug your bag on top of your home scale. If you don’t have a scale, you’ll have to take your chances at the airport and risk getting hit with an overweight fee or having to transfer some items to your carry-on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can kiss these hassles goodbye for good by choosing a suitcase with a built-in weight indicator. If your bag is over 50 pounds, this indicator will turn red, letting you know you need to lighten the load before heading to the airport.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Water-resistant zipper tape</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Standard zippers often have tiny crevices where water could creep inside. By choosing a suitcase with water-resistant zipper tape, you won’t need to worry about this.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>TSA-approved locks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you want to keep your valuables secure, you may choose to add a lock to your suitcase. However, it’s important to know that TSA has rules about the types of suitcase locks that are allowed.<sup>3</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At BÉIS, we make things easier for you by including a TSA-approved lock with each of our suitcases.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>A retractable bag attach strap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – After lugging your carry-on bags around all day, it’s nice to load them onto your suitcase after you pick it up at the baggage claim. However, your carry-ons may fall off if you don’t secure them properly. By purchasing a suitcase with a retractable bag attach strap, you can attach them with confidence. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Cushioned pillow handle </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Even if your suitcase has four wheels, it can still hurt your hands if the handle is uncomfortable. By choosing a suitcase with a cushioned pillow handle, you'll enjoy a pillow-soft grip. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At BÉIS, our luggage comes with all of these useful features so you can enjoy a comfortable, hassle-free travel experience every time.

<h2><strong>What Are the Best Places to Buy Luggage?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luggage shopping can be done online or in-store. If you visit an in-person store, your options may be limited to what they have on the floor. If you shop online, you can easily compare different models and choose the one that offers the features you need most. </span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>In a perfect world, we could stay snuggled in bed with our little ones all day, every day. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">world, however, we rarely stay in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling with toddlers can be tricky. While they’re more independent than a newborn, this new stage of life can be both a blessing and a curse—especially when traveling. It’s important for moms to find the right balance between letting little ones explore, without having to chase after them every second of the trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there are ways to make this process easier. One way to make it easier on yourself is finding the right </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whether you’re traveling for work or pleasure, here are the 6 best tips for globetrotting with your toddler.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 Have Your Documents in Order</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re flying with kids, it’s important to gather the appropriate documents well in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Babies under two years of age can technically sit in your lap free of charge when flying. Any child older than two, however, will need their own seat on the plane. In order to prove your baby is young enough to sit in your lap, you’ll need some form of identification that states their age. Examples may include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passport</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birth certificate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immunization record</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When flying out of the country, babies of all ages will need a passport (or travel visa, if required). You’ll need to submit these documents at least 6 weeks in advance, in order to receive your baby’s passport.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><b><i>The bottom line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Babies need some form of ID when flying on a plane, but the options are much more flexible than adult travelers. A birth certificate or immunization record will work for domestic travel, while a passport is required for international flights. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 Keep Them Comfy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re flying, driving, or taking the train—comfort is going to be key when traveling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with your kid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is particularly important for long trips; if your toddler isn’t able to fall asleep, there’s bound to be an unplanned tantrum or two on your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">family travel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">itinerary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep your toddler comfortable while traveling, consider bringing along these cozy <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/diaper-bag-essentials-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diaper bag essentials</a>:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Blankets <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Planes and trains can get chilly, especially when the A.C. vent is on full power directly above you. Pack some extra blankets on your trip to keep your baby feeling warm and snug from take off to touch down. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Headphones <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Some toddlers have a higher threshold for headphones than others. If you can get your little one to keep them on, a cushioned pair of headphones can help cancel out noise from the plane, vehicle, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fellow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">passengers. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Car seat <span style="font-weight: 400;">– While car seats on long </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">car ride</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trips with toddlers are essential, you can invest in one for air travel, too. Although not technically required, the Federal Aviation Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics both </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> encourage parents to use a car seat or CARES harness when flying with young children.<sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A car seat not only keeps your baby safe from turbulence, but it also offers a more comfortable position that may help them fall asleep more easily. Besides, does anyone </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> find airplane seats comfortable, anyway?</span>
</li>
</b><br>
<p><b><i>The bottom line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The more comfortable you can make your toddler, the easier your trip will be. While it may require a little more luggage, you’ll be thankful you brought a blanket, pair of headphones, or a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toddler</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> car seat.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" title="baby travel bags"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/BEIS_CTA3.png?v=1617301804" alt="" style="float: none;" width="496" height="248"></a></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#3 Use the Bathroom Every Chance You Can</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It probably comes as no surprise that toddlers go to the bathroom a lot. I mean, who can blame them? Their bladders are small, just like their little hands and feet!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In fact, they go so much that you might want to consider getting a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-portable-changing-pad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel changing pad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, you’ll want to double up on bathroom breaks when traveling with a toddler. This means hitting up the restroom every chance you get, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first get to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the airport or train station</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start driving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time you stop for gas</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning and end of any layovers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the pilot turns the seatbelt sign on (because once it’s on, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s on for a while<sup>3</sup></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same logic can be applied to toddlers in diapers, as well. While a younger baby may not be able to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">say</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they need to go, they can certainly communicate it in other ways (such as kicking and screaming).</span></p>
<p><b><i>The bottom line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A full bladder or a wet diaper isn’t fun for anyone, especially on a long trip. Make sure to utilize the bathroom whenever you get the chance. Even if it may seem excessive, it’s better to be safe than sorry.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/DSC09416.jpg?v=1616793087" alt="Baby books and toys ready for trip with toddler" style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4 Have Entertainment On Hand</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone can get bored on a flight or a road trip. Traveling simply isn’t the exciting part, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">arriving</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at your destination is. That’s why we can’t blame toddlers for becoming a little fussy during long bouts of flying or driving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on family vacation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—because they’re totally right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, it’s important to have a few entertainment options on hand. This may mean:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packing a tablet in your carry on or backpack</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bringing along a few different </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toys</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downloading their favorite movies and shows beforehand (to avoid WiFi trouble)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packing some of their favorite books<sup>4</sup></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried about having space for these extra items, BÉIS has you covered. Our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-carry-on-roller-in-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry On Roller Luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be expanded by two extra inches, giving you the space needed to pack just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more stuffed animal than you normally could.</span></p>
<p><b><i>The bottom line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Long flights and car rides can get boring. Having a couple different entertainment options is never a bad idea for a traveling toddler. Download some shows and movies onto a tablet, grab a stuffed animal or two, and do everything you can to keep them busy. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#5 Have Snacks at the Ready</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults aren’t the only ones who get </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hangry</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And adding a crying, hungry baby to the stress of traveling will quickly have you turning the car around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re flying with an infant, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">every airline lets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you take a certain amount of formula or breast milk in your carry on. Unfortunately, snack time gets a bit more challenging when you’re flying with a toddler. Since you can’t bring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> food through security, you’ll need to grab some treats once you’re at the airport. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some easy snack ideas that will last during a long flight or road trip include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granola bars</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">String cheese</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dry cereal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham crackers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruit snacks<sup>5</sup></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tasty treats don’t need to be refrigerated, making them the perfect choice for any form of traveling. If you’re heading out in a car, make sure to stock up a few days beforehand. At the airport, look for a drug store or newsstand that might sell these toddler-friendly foods.</span></p>
<p><b><i>The bottom line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pack some snack options that don’t require refrigeration. This will prevent a case of hangry crying, which is the last thing you want while you’re trying to keep your eyes on the road.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#6 Have a Separate Baby Bag</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before you became a mom, you likely dreaded the packing process. Now you’re in charge of a whole other human with their own needs, on top of your luggage. Needless to say, the whole thing can be pretty exhausting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best solution for this packing problem? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Separate bags.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your toddler probably doesn’t need an entire suitcase to themselves, but having a separate bag—like the </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-diaper-bag?variant=34521674481800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÉIS Backpack Diaper Bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—is a great way to keep your baby’s belongings in one, easy-to-access place. The best part about the BÉIS </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-diaper-bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaper Bag Backpack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? You can throw it on your back and forget about it. No rolling around an additional suitcase through the airport, or stuffing the trunk with unnecessary luggage. </span></p>
<p><b><i>The bottom line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Everyone hates packing, but having an extra bag just for baby can save you a lot of time and frustration. Find a simple bag that has enough pockets for all your toddler’s needs so that nothing gets mixed up or disorganized.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/COPY_IMAGE_2_d2aef38f-a1cc-4ff2-9629-7c818980c677.jpg?v=1616793017" alt="Mother breastfeeding baby on a bed. In the front is half packed luggage " style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h2>

With the right supplies, snacks, and a few entertainment options, you’ll find that even a two year old can make a great passenger when given the chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these helpful travel tips, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secret to being a mom-on-the-move is BÉIS.

In this blog, we'll talk through the must-haves for your cosmetic case and how to organize them.</span><p><a class="read-more" href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/essentials-for-any-makeup-bag">More</a></p>]]>

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re tuned into the online world of beauty gurus, like James Charles and Michelle Phan,<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you may be tempted to accumulate plenty of makeup products in the pursuit of looking your best. However, this can leave you with an overflowing makeup bag that’s hard to organize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to your beauty routine and skin care, sometimes less is more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By going back to basics, you can simplify your makeup bag and organize it properly. In turn, your morning routine will be that much easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we’ll review the essential products you should have in your makeup bag and offer a few ways that you can organize them strategically.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Essentials for Makeup Bags</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has their own set of makeup staples. Here’s a makeup bag essentials list that you can pick and choose from to create your ideal setup. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Face Products</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t want flawless, radiant skin? One of the many gifts of makeup is that it can transform your complexion, even on your worst skin days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essentials for makeup bag that can give you the fresh look you’re searching for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Face primer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Face primer isn’t the most exciting beauty product on the market so it's easy to overlook. However, face primer can give your skin a smoother look and keep your makeup looking fresh all day. By adding this product to your list of essentials, you can spend less time on touch-ups throughout the day. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Foundation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Foundation is truly the “foundation” of flawless skin. It can even your skin tone, brighten your complexion, and mask any imperfections. Depending on your skin type and coverage preference, you can choose a sheer, medium, or full coverage foundation. For example, this best-selling </span><a href="https://www.violetgrey.com/product/vital-skin-foundation-stick/WES-BF2112002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westman Atelier Vital Skin Foundation Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers a luminous full coverage. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t already have a favorite foundation, many makeup artists would be happy to help you find your perfect match. Once you’ve found the right shade of foundation, you can enjoy flawless skin every day and the confidence that comes with it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Concealer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– While foundation can give you a clean slate, sometimes you need a little </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">extra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coverage in certain areas. Whether you have dark circles under your eyes or the occasional blemish, a little concealer can do the trick. Like foundation, concealers come in a range of shades, formulas, and coverages. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Bronzer</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Having an even skin tone is one thing, but many people also want some color in their complexion. Bronzer can give you a sun-kissed glow </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UV ray damage. If you’re advanced in your makeup application skills, you can even use bronzer to contour your face like the Kardashians.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Highlighter </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Highlighter is another staple product if you want a radiant face. It can give your face a luminescent glow and enhance the dimension of your complexion. Simply add a little highlighter to the tops of your cheeks, the forefront of your nose, below your eyebrows, and in your cupid’s bow. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Blush </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– After concealing and contouring, you may want to add a bit of rosiness back to your cheeks. Blush can help you do just that. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your skin tone, certain shades of blush will compliment you better than others. If you’re looking for some inspiration, this </span><a href="https://www.violetgrey.com/product/baby-cheeks-blush-stick/WES-BF2617002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers six different stunning shades. Once you’ve found your perfect shade, add a touch of it to your cheeks and enjoy your newfound healthy glow.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Setting powder</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – After perfecting your makeup, the last thing you want is for it to fade off throughout the day. A setting powder can ensure that your makeup stays put. Some setting powders even prevent your skin from getting oily during the day or offer moisturizing benefits if you're prone to dry skin. </span>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your face makeup is ready to go, it’s time to draw some attention to your beautiful eyes. They’re the window to your soul, after all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some essential eye makeup essentials to include in your makeup bag:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Eye primer </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Like face primer, eye primer gives your eyelids the perfect base for the rest of your eye look, whether you do a sultry smokey eye or something simpler. Primer will also keep your eye makeup from sliding off, getting smudged, or creasing throughout the day.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Eyeshadow </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– The eyes may be the window to the soul, but they’re also the perfect canvas for your cosmetic creativity. Eyeshadows come in many different shades and finishes. While you can experiment with any color of the rainbow, a neutral eyeshadow palette should be on your list of essentials. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Eyeliner </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– After dusting your eyelids with a shimmery shadow, the next step is to line them with a little eyeliner. Not only can eyeliner make your lashes look thicker, but it can also make your eyes pop, especially if you choose the right color. Black eyeliner is a go-to for many people, but brown, dark gray, and deep purple eyeliners can bring out the color of your eyes.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Mascara</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – To finish off the eyes, you need a good mascara, like the luxurious </span><a href="https://www.violetgrey.com/product/eye-love-you-mascara/WES-BE3324001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westman Atelier Eye Love You Mascara</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Mascara may be the most essential product in your eye makeup routine. After all, mascara does wonders for your eyes by lengthening, thickening, and darkening your eyelashes. Adding a little mascara can instantly make you look more awake and put together, even if you opt for an otherwise minimal makeup get-up. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lip Products</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, you need to give your lips a little TLC. Here are some essential lip products you should always have on hand:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Lip balm </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– No amount of lip gloss or lipstick can overcompensate for dry, cracked lips. Before you do anything else, start your lip routine with a hydrating lip balm, like this replenishing </span><a href="https://www.violetgrey.com/product/baume-de-rose/BYT-V18300008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Terry Baume de Rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This way, your lips won’t get dry or chapped during the day.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Lip gloss </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Lip gloss can add a lovely sheen to your smile and polish off your entire look. As an added bonus, it’s easy to apply, even when you don’t have access to a mirror. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Lipstick</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Even if you don’t wear lipstick every day, having a little lip color or statement lipstick on hand is essential. A bold red or bright pink lipstick can serve as the focal point of your outfit. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Application Products</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After stocking your makeup bag with the essentials, you need the right tools to apply them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the basic beauty tools you need: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Makeup brushes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – High-quality makeup brushes can help you blend your favorite products like a pro. While high-quality brushes are a little costlier, they are well worth the investment. They will stand the test of time, especially if you clean them regularly and store them properly. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>A beauty blender</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – If you prefer using liquid face products, you may also want to add a beauty blender to your applicator arsenal.<sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These strategically shaped sponges can give you a flawless finish, free of any streaks or lines. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Tips for Organizing Makeup Bag</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Essentials_For_Any_Makeup_Bag_copy1.jpg?v=1614285215" style="float: none;"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know the essentials of a well-stocked makeup bag, let’s review some ways you can keep all of your beauty products organized, clean, and easy to find. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Choose the Right Makeup Bag</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking for the ideal makeup bag, try to find one that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Is made of durable material</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Since you're going to use your makeup bag daily, you should invest in one that will stay in good condition. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Is easy to clean </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Makeup can get messy. After a couple of weeks, your makeup bag will probably be covered in shimmery dust and debris. By choosing a cosmetic case that’s easy to clean, you can freshen it up faster and save yourself a lot of trouble. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Has a separate compartment for brushes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – After investing in high-quality makeup brushes, it's important to take good care of them. You can protect their bristles by storing them in a separate compartment within your makeup bag. This will also ensure that they’re easy to find. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Place Your Makeup Products Inside Strategically</strong></h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Essentials_For_Any_Makeup_Bag_copy2.jpg?v=1614285262" style="float: none;"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve chosen a makeup bag, you need to know how to place your makeup essentials inside of it properly. Here are some helpful organizational tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place larger products at the bottom of your makeup bag and smaller products on top</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place cotton pads inside your makeup palettes if they have glass mirrors inside (this will keep them from shattering)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack palettes and group together long, slender products (like eyeliner, mascara, lipstick, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also wipe down your products with a makeup wipe every so often and wash your brushes regularly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By following these tips, you’ll always have a fresh, organized makeup bag ready to go. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Stylishly Store Your <i>Must Haves</i> in Makeup Bags</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizing your makeup bag is an easy process once you know these helpful tips and tricks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re ready to treat yourself to a new makeup bag, look no further than the </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories/products/beis-cosmetic-case-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÈIS travel makeup &amp; cosmetic case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half the fun of booking a vacation is daydreaming about it beforehand. During the days leading up to your trip, you can imagine all the Instagrammable moments that await you. What will you do each day? Where will you eat? Most importantly, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what will you wear</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As any fashionista knows, no outfit is complete without its finishing touches. Jewelry can take a plain t-shirt and jeans to the next level or glam up an already dazzling dress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering how to pack jewelry when traveling, it’s important to understand the challenges involved. Jewelry items are fragile, tangle-prone, and easy to lose. Fortunately, we have some tips and tricks for packaging jewelry properly when traveling.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Pack Jewelry For Travel</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you love costume jewelry or fine diamonds, you naturally want to keep your special pieces safe, organized, and tangle-free as you travel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some tips on packaging material to help you do just that:</span></p>
<h2><strong>#1 Choose Your Travel Jewelry Wisely</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, you need to decide what jewelry items you’re going to bring with you. It’s tempting to bring all of your favorite pieces. However, you should be cautious about what jewelry you bring on vacation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, it might be best to leave expensive or precious jewelry at home. Traveling with valuable pieces is not recommended, especially if you’re going somewhere where they could make you a target for theft.<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before you decide to bring a special piece on your trip, ask yourself:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would I struggle to afford to replace this piece if it got lost or stolen?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this piece sentimental to me?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would my trip be ruined if this piece went missing?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, it might be a better idea to play it safe and leave these high-value items at home.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/3_ef142f9f-4516-49eb-aaf2-da7369103eb8.png?v=1623324699" alt="shop luggage accessories" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>#2 Decide Which Jewelry You’re Going to Wear On Your Travel Day</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you absolutely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bring a few pricey pieces with you, like your wedding set or everyday necklace, it’s a good idea to wear them while you travel to your destination. This way, they’ll be safely on your person at all times, rather than in an unsupervised suitcase somewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, if your luggage gets lost (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fingers crossed it doesn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), you won’t need to go through the added stress of losing your favorite jewelry pieces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you know what jewelry you’re going to wear on your travel day, you can start packing the rest of your adornments.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#3 Pack Each Piece of Jewelry Carefully: The DIY Addition</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve chosen the jewelry pieces you’re comfortable traveling with, it’s time to pack them in a way that will ensure they stay organized, protected, and most importantly, untangled! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every piece of jewelry comes with slightly different travel considerations. For example, a delicate necklace is notorious for turning into a tangled mess,<sup>2</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earrings often lose their backs, and rings can act like secret escape artists if they're not properly stored away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some useful DIY strategies for packing each type of jewelry:</span></p>
<h3><strong>How to Pack Necklaces</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering how to go about packing necklaces for travel, the secret is to keep them physically separated from one another. You can do so by putting each necklace in its own jewelry case or Ziploc bag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this strategy will keep your necklaces from tangling with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">each other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it’s not a foolproof method for preventing tangles within the necklace chain itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accomplish </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goal, you have a few options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>The Straw Method</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – One DIY trick is to thread your necklace through a straw and fasten the clasp afterward. The straw will serve as a physical barrier, preventing the chain from getting tangled and knotted together. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>The Cling Wrap Method </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– If your travel necklace is too thick for the straw method (most statement necklaces would fall into this category), you can use cling wrap to keep it tangle-free instead. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this method, simply lay down a large piece of cling wrap and place your necklace on one side of it. Make sure the necklace chain isn’t overlapping anywhere. After that, wrap the other side of the cling wrap over your necklace and press it down to create a cling wrap seal. This seal will keep your necklace in place and tangle-free.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How to Pack Rings</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to bring a few rings with you, it’s important to make sure they don’t get lost in your luggage. These tiny accessories are easy to lose and hard to find. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can keep your rings from wandering off by storing them in a designated jewelry pouch or plastic baggy. If you want to go one step further, consider attaching all of your rings together with a metal O-ring. This will ensure that none of them slip out of the pouch or bag while they’re packed away in your luggage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another DIY hack for packing rings is to place them in a pill case or mint tin. Just make sure that whatever container you use won’t pop open inside your luggage. </span></p>
<h3><strong>How to Pack Bracelets</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From bangles to beaded bracelets, a little arm candy can instantly jazz up your outfit. However, similar to tangled necklaces, some types of bracelets are more prone to tangling and scratches than others. If your chosen bracelets are slightly malleable, they could also get squished, bent, or damaged under the pressure of the rest of your luggage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep your bracelets safe, simply roll up a small washcloth or towel to create a DIY bracelet display. After that, slide your bracelets onto it and place the display in a large plastic bag. This will keep all of your bracelets from getting squished, scratched, tangled, or lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your travel bracelets aren’t prone to get damaged or tangled, you can simply place them in soft jewelry pouches for safekeeping. </span></p>
<h3><strong>How to Pack Earrings</strong></h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Pack_Jewelry_featured_image_copy_image_1.jpg?v=1614286333" style="float: none;"></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Earrings are possibly the trickiest </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel accessories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pack. Whether you love studs, hoops, or dangling earrings, these jewels tend to be delicate and easy to lose. The last thing you want is to lose an earring back on your way to your destination.</span>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prevent these packing problems, you need to get a little creative. Here are some options:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Use a button</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Buttons are a fantastic DIY earring storage solution. Simply insert your earrings into the holes of the button and secure them with the backs. Most buttons have two holes, making them ideal for a pair of earrings. After that, place the bejeweled buttons in a soft jewelry pouch or plastic bag. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Use a piece of cardboard </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Another way you can keep your earrings in one place is by piercing a piece of cardboard with them and fastening them to it. This will create a DIY earring display. After that, place the entire cardboard earring display into a plastic baggy or small bag to ensure none of your earrings fall off and go missing.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Use a pill case </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– As with rings, pillboxes are great earring organizers. Their tiny compartments can help you separate each pair of earrings from one another. Just make sure to seal the compartments securely to prevent them from popping open in your suitcase. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>#4 Simplify the Packing Process With a Hanging Jewelry Organizer</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all of these DIY jewelry packing tips are viable options, they result in a hodgepodge of different jewelry containers. You can streamline everything significantly by purchasing a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories/products/the-hanging-jewelry-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hanging jewelry organizer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will enable you to ditch the cumbersome pillboxes, plastic baggies, and other DIY packing solutions for good. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/How_to_Pack_Jewelry_featured_image_copy_image_2.jpg?v=1614286381" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>

<b>Clear zipper pockets in a variety of sizes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – With a hanging jewelry organizer, you can swap out your slew of jewelry pouches for a streamlined set of compartments instead. These compartments come in a variety of sizes, giving everything from your statement necklaces to your tiny studs a dedicated home. </span>
</li>
</ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being on the go with baby is hard enough. Tack on an overflowing, disorganized diaper bag, and you have the perfect recipe for frustration. Whether you’ve got a nursing newborn or a teething toddler on your hands, having the right supplies can help you be the ultimate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile mom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to clean up the inside of your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-diaper-bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check out these handy tips to stay prim, proper, and—most importantly—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepared</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Read on for the ultimate diaper bag checklist!</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Do You Really Need in a Diaper Bag?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">terribly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stressful day and a breezy one can often come down to a well-packed diaper bag. When you’re toting around the ultimate baby essentials, you’ll be prepared for even the fastest curveballs life (and your little one) can throw at you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, here’s the ultimate diaper bag checklist that every mom needs:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaper-related essentials</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re called diaper bags</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a reason. And although your diaper bag will probably end up doubling as a purse for the foreseeable future, that doesn’t take away from its </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">original purpose</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the basic diaper bag essentials every mom needs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Extra diapers</strong> – This one may seem like a no-brainer—but you’d be surprised by just how <i>many</i> diapers babies will go through in a day. Moms should expect to change their newborn’s diaper up to 12 times a day (and closer to 8 times a day for older babies).<sup>1</sup> The perfect diaper bag will have enough compartments for all the extra diapers you need, and prevent a diaper tornado from brewing inside. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wipes</strong> – A full pack of wipes is another essential for quick changes. All the diapers in the world won’t be much help if you don’t have a baby wipe for your baby’s bottom.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Changing mat</strong> – Depending on where you’re going, there may not always be a changing table available. That’s why many moms opt for a portable changing mat—like our <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-portable-changing-pad?variant=34521778880648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel changing pad</span></a>. This padded, easy-to-clean material will quickly become your diaper bag must-have, and the changing pad even has additional pockets for diapers and wipes (in case your bag is running out of space).<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Rash ointment</strong> – Even the quickest diaper change can’t always prevent a dreaded diaper rash. Fortunately, a small tube of diaper cream or rash ointment can go a long way—<i style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">without </span></i>taking up much space in your diaper bag. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A change of clothes</strong> – As much as we’d love for accidents to stay within the confines of your baby’s diaper, this isn’t always the case. On particularly messy days, it never hurts to have an extra outfit in your diaper bag, <i style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just in case. </span></i>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your baby may not have a cell phone yet, but that doesn’t stop nature from calling. And when nature calls while you’re out and about, having all the necessary supplies will make a quick clean up possible. </span></p>
<h3><a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" title="baby travel bags"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/BEIS_CTA3.png?v=1617301804" alt="" width="450" height="225"></span></a></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-diaper essentials</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we have the basics covered, it’s time to delve into the more creative items. In addition to ointment and wipes, your diaper bag can carry all the little things that make mom life easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a checklist of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-diaper</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> diaper bag essentials for newborns and toddlers:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Pacifier <span style="font-weight: 400;">– If your baby is teething, it’s always good to keep something soothing on hand for their pain. Pacifiers are small, inexpensive, and won’t take up much space—and the BÉIS diaper bag even comes with a pacifier slot </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an attached teething ring (for gum-related emergencies). </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Bottles and snacks <span style="font-weight: 400;">– When your baby is hungry, they let you know right away. It doesn’t matter what time of the day it is, the munchies are the munchies (or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sippies</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if they’re still on the bottle). You’ll want to make sure you’ve picked out a diaper bag with enough room for any</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> baby food </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or feeding gear, like pumps, bottles, and milk bags. Nursing moms who want to stay extra organized can opt for our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-bottle-cooler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bottle cooler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—a sleek, insulated bag that holds up to two bottles at a time. Simply slide this bad boy in your diaper bag and you’ll be ready to go. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Toys <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Who said your diaper bag can’t be fun? While it’s probably never going to look like Santa’s toy sack, having a few entertainment options on hand never hurts. Pack away at least one small toy—like a stuffed animal or a rattle—for emergency cases of boredom. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Seasonal necessities <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Depending on the time of year, your diaper bag may benefit from a few seasonal necessities to keep your baby safe and comfortable. In the summer, you’ll want to pop a cute little hat and some baby-safe sunscreen in your bag. For chilly winter days, an extra </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">swaddle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blanket and mittens will always come in handy.</span>
</li>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Keep a Diaper Bag Organized</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to put in your diaper bag, it’s time to learn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pack it properly for maximum effectiveness. Having all the essentials will only be so helpful if you’re still struggling to find them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">some of the best tips to utilize when packing a neat, organized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> diaper bag:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Have Ziploc bags on hand <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sometimes you’ve got a dirty diaper on your hands, and simply no place to put it. The last thing you want</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are soiled diapers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> staining the lining of your bag (or, even worse, wafting out an unpleasant smell). That’s where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ziploc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bag </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes in handy. Keeping a few disposable, resealable bags can save you when a trash can simply isn’t within reach. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Pick a side <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Your diaper bag isn’t just for baby belongings. Your stuff should fit too. But having two people’s belongings in the mix can sometimes lead to confusion. In order to avoid pulling out lipstick when you were looking for a pacifier, designate one side of your bag to personal items. Searching for your wallet will be a lot easier when it's not lodged in the same pocket as the extra diapers!</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Pockets, pockets, <i>pockets</i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">– If it wasn’t clear, pockets are crucial. When you’re lugging around everything under the kitchen sink, it’s important to have enough places to put your stuff. Fortunately, all of the BÉIS baby collection bags come with pockets galore! Moms can stay organized with ease by having separate pouches for wipes, bottles, toys, and even a handy laptop sleeve (after all, having a baby doesn’t mean you can’t send a quick work email). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÉIS even carries a diaper bag backpack loaded with pockets as well as a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-tote-insert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper bag organizer insert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your tote! </span>
</li>
</b><br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is a Diaper Bag Really Necessary?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new mom, your diaper bag is likely going to replace your purse. When you’re <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/6-tips-for-traveling-with-toddlers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">traveling with </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/6-tips-for-traveling-with-toddlers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toddlers</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the load becomes a lot heavier than your wallet, keys, and an extra lip</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> balm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Babies come with a whole bunch of needed supplies. From feeding to changing (and everything that happens in between) you’ll need a new tool every hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why it’s so important to have a sturdy, spacious diaper bag—but the traditional one-size-fits-all bag isn’t for everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At BÉIS, we’ve created a lineup of baby bags that fit any mom’s style. From small totes to large bags, and even stylish <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backpacks</a>, you have options when it comes to your diaper bag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line? You’re going to need </span><b>something</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Might as well make it fashionable too.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/COPY_IMAGE_2.jpg?v=1616791828" alt="Dad holding smiling baby on the bed next to a diaper bag" style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Age Do You Stop Using a Diaper Bag?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A diaper bag typically stops being necessary when your baby is no longer in diapers. Most kids start using the toilet between 18 and 24 months, but some may take up to three years to leave diapers behind fully.<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, it’s important to note that many moms end up </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">liking </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their diaper bags. Even after your baby has mastered the art of potty training, there’s still plenty of items you’ll be hauling around, like even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bigger</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toys and clothes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, everyone is different. While some moms may ditch the diaper bag as soon as possible, others choose to stick with the big-bag lifestyle. It’s really up to you!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÉIS: The Diaper Bag You’ll Want to Keep Using</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a diaper bag that’s both utilitarian </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stylish, look no further than BÉIS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our baby collection is designed to make busy moms feel fashionable, even when they’re lugging around a value pack of Huggies. Choose from a variety of designs, like our Backpack Diaper Bag, Pumping Tote, and even a portable Stroller Caddy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what’s on your diaper bag checklist, you can carry it in style with BÉIS!</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>You travel because you want to see the world and take home all the experiences it has to offer you. However, you’re not too jazzed about taking home the world’s germs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between riding to the airport, cycling through the luggage carousel, and rolling through the cobblestone streets of Rome (or the asphalt of Chicago), your suitcase has touched a lot of unfamiliar hands and rubbed against a lot of new surfaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we’ll discuss how to clean a suitcase and </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel luggage sets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, covering: </span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get started!</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unpack Your Suitcase</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing to do after returning from a trip is to resist the urge to plop your suitcase down on your bed, empty it halfheartedly, then plop yourself on the bed shortly after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because there’s probably a bunch of germs that hitched a ride on your suitcase that you don’t want to bring deep into your home. So, until your suitcase is clean and disinfected, try to keep it in your entryway, garage, or on your porch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by unpacking. If unpacking for you is more like shoving the contents of your suitcase, unfolded and unorganized, into a closet corner until you’re ready to deal with them, who can blame you? Just make sure that anything that makes it into your home is clean first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For clothes, this means you can simply throw all your dirty clothes into a washer when you get home. As for shoes, toiletry bottles, electronics, and other hard objects, you can wipe these down with a disinfecting wipe. Easy peasy! Now, the real cleaning begins.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Unpack_Your_Suitcase_07b3482d-c866-4727-b239-e31ed3992673.jpg?v=1611234185" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning vs Disinfecting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, there’s a difference between cleaning and disinfecting, and one is not better than the other. When it comes to how to clean luggage (or any surface for that matter), you have to do both. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take it from the CDC. They say that cleaning is “the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs.” Meanwhile, disinfecting is the use of chemicals “to kill germs on surfaces.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you’re doing one and not the other, there may still be dirt or germs from who-knows-where vacationing on your luggage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That goes for both the inside and outside of your suitcase. Let’s start with the inside.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning the Inside of Your Suitcase</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure everything is out of your suitcase and check all the pockets before you get started on cleaning the interior. Now it’s time to do three things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>De-crumb your suitcase</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – You’ll want to get rid of crumbs or big pieces of debris. You could do this by vacuuming the inside of your suitcase or, if you’re outside, by just turning your suitcase upside down and giving it a good shake. You’d be surprised how many snack crumbs and gum wrappers you can find living in the crevices of your suitcase.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Wash the interior</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – All kinds of things touch the interior of your suitcase—maybe your hiking shoes or your favorite book that goes with you everywhere (and has touched more surfaces than you can count). So, give the inside a good wash with a wet washcloth, mild soap, and water (nothing too crazy, you still want to preserve the fabric). Of course the next step is to disinfect. This can be done with a disinfectant wipe.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Remove stains</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – As long as makeup and wine exist, stains are an inevitable part of life and travel. Luckily, a stain remover and a bit of scrubbing should do the trick.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use Packing Cubes</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning luggage is great fun and all, but you could keep dirty items away from your suitcase’s interior lining altogether by using </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-packing-cubes?_pos=1&amp;_sid=116d84be6&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing cubes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This way, when you get home, you can simply empty everything from each packing cube and wash the cubes themselves rather than the interior lining. This will save you time and elbow grease, but also preserve your suitcase.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/2.png?v=1619029735" alt="shop luggage" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do You Clean a Smelly Suitcase?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe your suitcase isn’t dirty, per se—it just smells funky. Here are a few things that can cause this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t travel very often, so your suitcase spends a lot of time stored away in a dark, warm place (like a basement or a garage).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have a very old or vintage suitcase that has a lot of stories, and some smells to go along with them.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your suitcase has simply held one too many wet swimsuits or opened chip bags.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the reason for your smelly suitcase, consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Airing it out</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Sometimes what a suitcase needs after being stored away for a long time is some air and sunlight. Try opening up your suitcase for a few hours where the sun and air can get to it.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Using baking soda</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Sprinkling baking soda inside a suitcase is a popular method for getting rid of the musty smell. The amount of baking soda will depend on the amount of stink, so sprinkle until you’re happy. Then shut the suitcase for up to a week and vacuum it up when the stink is gone.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Using kitty litter</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – This can be effective, but messy. So, you can do this by filling a pillowcase with kitty litter and placing the pillowcase inside the suitcase for a few days.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Spraying with white vinegar and water</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – White vinegar truly is the versatile household product everyone says it is. Try one part white vinegar and three parts water in a spray bottle and allow your suitcase to air dry.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For preventing odor, stick a dryer sheet in your suitcase before leaving home to keep everything in it smelling like you just washed it.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning the Outside of Your Suitcase</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the outside of your luggage could talk, it would have some pretty wild stories, but you probably don’t want your luggage to look as battle-worn as it is. Cleaning it efficiently can make it look like new.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard Shell Luggage</span></h3>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wondering about <a href="%20https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/hard-vs-soft-luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hard vs soft luggage?</a> The exterior of a hard shell suitcase is water resistant and much more durable to washing and scrubbing than soft shell suitcases. So, if you’re a clean freak, this is your time to shine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning a hard sided suitcase can simply be done with a damp cloth and some mild soap. Scrub to your heart’s content. Then rinse and disinfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, this is where a disinfecting wipe comes in handy. An alternative to a disinfectant wipe is a solution of half a cup of bleach per gallon of water. Wipe all around the suitcase exterior and try to keep your suitcase wet with this solution for five minutes. This should kill whatever germs your suitcase picked up from being roughly handled and rolled around in that greasy stuff they put on luggage carousels.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scuffed Luggage</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s rare that your suitcase will make it home without at least one scuff mark. Even after a good scrub, finding some scuff marks on your beautiful suitcase is heartbreaking, but normal. Don’t worry! That is why we created the </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-beis-buffer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BEIS Buffer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to keep your hardside luggage looking just as chic as when you bought it.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do You Clean Fabric Luggage?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To clean the exterior of a fabric suitcase, you’ll need:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scrub brush</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A foaming fabric spray (i.e. carpet cleaner or sofa cleaner)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vacuum</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spray your entire suitcase with foaming spray. Then scrub with a brush, focusing mostly on visible tough stains. After letting your product sit on your suitcase (for however long the product advises), vacuum off the foam. You can repeat this for stubborn dirt and tough stains.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning the Bits and Bobs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you’re cleaning your suitcase, it’s important to get it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clean. Make sure you’re not skipping over these areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>The handle</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – This is the part of your suitcase that is probably touched the most by unknown hands.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>The wheels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Suitcase wheels that are stopped up with dirt, not only perform worse, but also become really efficient at germing up your floors. Put on some gloves, close your eyes, and give your wheels a good scrub.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>The bottom</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Similar to the wheels, the bottom of your suitcase picks up a lot of dirt from the ground, so give this part of your suitcase some extra attention when you’re cleaning.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>The pockets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Consider using a small brush to get into the small corners and crevices of your suitcase pockets and remove any dirt that might be tucked away in there. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Cleaning_the_Bits_and_Bobs.jpg?v=1611234225" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let Your Suitcase Dry Overnight</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After your suitcase is fresh and spotless, open it up and lay it out (outside if you can), so that it can completely dry overnight (a closed, wet suitcase is a recipe for mold and mildew).</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Yourself!</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally! It’s time to wash your hands, change your clothes, and officially come home. Take a load off, you’ve earned it.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make Travel Easy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the preparation that goes into traveling, knowing how to wash a suitcase is just one of the many things you have to plan for. The last thing you want to worry about is if your luggage can handle the trip. So, durable and easily washable luggage can mean a shorter distance between you and your television when you get home. Luckily, that’s exactly what BEIS specializes in- hard luggage sets that add a flair to your travel look while also providing functionality.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>When planning for a trip, it can be easy to feel like luggage comes last. Maybe you’ve already created a strict budget, made a hundred reservations, and agonized over what you’re going to wear. When it’s time to grab the luggage, you might want to just settle for whatever gets you from point A to point B.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a lot can happen between point A and point B. One thing is for sure: You need </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel luggage sets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will last you throughout this journey and many more. </span></p>

And between hard or soft luggage, which one will not only get you where you need to go, but with comfort and ease? This article will guide you through everything you should consider when deciding on hard vs soft luggage including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanliness </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessibility</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanliness </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-clean-a-suitcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to clean a suitcase</a> and keeping them clean, is hard or soft luggage better?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hard sided luggage is more prone to scuffing, these scuffs can be </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-beis-buffer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buffed away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quite easily while soft sided luggage tends to take on more persistent damage from:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Dirt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The fabric of soft sided luggage can make dirt more noticeable than it does on hard sided luggage. Also, the slicker surface of hard sided luggage can make it easy to wipe away dirt with a stray cafe napkin as you wait for your flight. When it comes to soft luggage, causal wiping can quickly turn into vigorous scrubbing, until you realize only soap and water will really do the job. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Germs </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Soft sided luggage is made of more porous fabric, while hard sided luggage is made of less absorbent material. With a hard sided suitcase, you can worry less about germs burrowing into the material of your suitcase, and you can wash away germs more easily.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Smells</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Soft luggage can absorb water, making it easier for it to trap smells and (if it stays wet for too long) mold and mildew. With hard sided cases, you can expect a level of water resistance that resists </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">smelliness</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessibility</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of situations where soft sided luggage makes your stuff more accessible. For example, this comes in handy in a cramped space where you can just squeeze your hand through a half-open zipper and get something out. Hard luggage can require you to completely open your bag which may not always be possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the lower accessibility you get with hard sided luggage may be more of a pro than a con. A cut or a slightly opened zipper on a soft suitcase can leave your items vulnerable to being lost or stolen. A hard sided suitcase requires more effort to get into, especially if it has a lock (as many </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard suitcases do</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Accessibility.jpg?v=1611233196" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soft sided suitcases—as is their namesake—are softer and more flexible than hard sided suitcases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, hard luggage has made great strides in flexibility. Many of today’s hard sided luggage is made with materials that offer more give than before:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Polycarbonate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – </span><a href="https://petergreenberg.com/2014/07/29/consider-buying-soft-hard-shell-luggage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polycarbonate luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flexes a little to absorb impact (it’s flexible enough to be used in contact lenses). If you’re wondering if hard luggage cracks, polycarbonate makes that concern a thing of the past.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/2.png?v=1619029735" alt="shop luggage" style="float: none;"></div>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to Avoid Overpacking? Hard Luggage is the Secret</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flexibility of soft luggage may appeal to doomsday packers, but in many instances, overpacking is an </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/16/21065669/psychology-over-under-packing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotional response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than a rational one. If you’re trying to curb your overpacking ways, hard luggage might actually do the trick. The rigidness of a hard sided suitcase can not only keep you from filling the limited space in your accommodations with the three extra outfits you brought, but it can also save you money by keeping your baggage weight in check.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durability</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re an avid traveler, you’ll want luggage that will stand up to all your adventures and not need frequent replacing. A quality hard sided suitcase can be the answer to this because hard luggage is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Less prone to ripping</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – As mentioned above, it’s so much more tempting to overpack with a soft suitcase. If you’re prone to overpacking, your poor zippers are working overtime and it’s a matter of time before you start to see tears in your luggage. This is not a problem with hard luggage.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>More weather resistant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – While a quality soft suitcase shouldn’t just disintegrate in the snow or wash away in the rain, hard luggage is simply better at standing up to weather conditions because it doesn’t take on as much water.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>More resistant to wear-and-tear</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Over time, luggage inevitably gets beat up. The material of hard sided luggage resists this by absorbing less dirt, grease, and water, which maintains the quality of the luggage. Also, luggage made with polycarbonate is more scratch resistant than the plastic materials of the past.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobility</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever tried to wheel a bloated, overstuffed soft suitcase around a crowded airport or onto a tight bus? It’s, to put it delicately,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an experience</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’re half-wheeling and half-lifting a leaning suitcase with a very unpredictable range of motion. And if you’re in a hurry? Good luck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, hard sided suitcases are easy to roll (either behind, in front, or beside you). Also, the rigidness of a hard sided suitcase makes it more stable, even when it’s heavily packed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in situations where you need to bob, weave, and glide quickly, hard luggage is the obvious choice.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protection</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re traveling with valuable, breakable items, hard luggage is the way to go. Soft luggage can squish and flatten under the weight of other luggage, but hard luggage will keep its shape, so that the stuff inside isn’t smashed. This is particularly important if you’re traveling with electronics, lotions, sunscreens, shampoos, or wine bottles.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weight of hard sided luggage vs soft sided luggage will depend on the individual luggage, but you may be surprised to find that many hard suitcases made of polycarbonate can be lighter than some soft luggage.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What About Aluminum Luggage?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we talked mostly about how soft luggage compares to polycarbonate luggage because of how common they are, but </span><a href="https://maphappy.org/2018/12/road-tested-the-core-differences-between-polycarbonate-and-aluminum-suitcases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aluminum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is another kind of hard luggage you may be considering for your travels. How does it stack up? </span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleanliness</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aluminum luggage is pretty comparable to polycarbonate in its ability to stay clean. Neither of them need much more than a wipe-down to get off dirt.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aluminum luggage is the least flexible of the current suitcase options on the market. Most people aren’t the most efficient packers, and while polycarbonate suitcases nudge you to stop overpacking, aluminum suitcases give you a real shove.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weight</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since aluminium is such a heavy material, aluminum suitcases can really pack on the pounds, which can be uncomfortable in your hands and a bit scary to lift into the overhead bin.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aluminum suitcase is designed to be nearly indestructible, and its rigid frame offers supreme protection of the items inside it. It is also resistant to weather and water. So, one of these could last you a lifetime.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last you a lifetime if you’re willing to look past all its nicks, dings, and dents that it will inevitably collect. Aluminum suitcases are far worse than soft or polycarbonate luggage at hiding their battle scars. </span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aluminum luggage is in the upper echelon price-wise. But for a heavy suitcase with very little flexibility that’s bound to show all its bang-ups, you probably won’t consider this option very cost-efficient.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Cost.jpg?v=1611233231" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Is Hard or Soft Luggage Better?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the recap of the hard shell vs soft shell luggage battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soft luggage is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More accessible</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More flexible</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hard polycarbonate luggage is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easier to keep clean </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More secure than softside luggage </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less prone to overstuffing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More durable than soft luggage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More mobile</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better than soft luggage at protecting breakable items</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Able to be very lightweight</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, aluminum luggage is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most durable</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The least prone to overstuffing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best at protecting breakable items</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In several categories, hardside luggage takes the gold (and all the clothes; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hurry up, we need to get packing!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">BEIS Hard Luggage: Made for Traveling in Style</span></h2>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ultimate parenting accessory. The box of treasures every new mom relies on for the many, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">many</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> items your baby needs. We’re talking, of course, about the diaper bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you spend a good chunk of your time with a newborn, it’s likely that you’ll be trading in clutches and wristlets for something with a little more space (and a lot more diapers). New mothers often find their <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/diaper-bags%20">diaper bag</a> turning into their everyday purse, and why not? With so many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">interior</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pockets, it’s a no brainer that you’d use it to carry both <a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diaper bag essentials</a> and personal goodies (who says rash cream and lip gloss can’t be side-by-side?). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a newcomer to the diaper bag lifestyle, you may be looking for some advice on making the transition from cross-body bag to cross-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, BÉIS has you covered in this department. Read on for everything you need to know about how to organize a diaper bag like a pro.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do You Really Need a Diaper Bag?</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/copyimage1_872224a0-9f4f-4728-9b09-437d22e29db5.jpg?v=1608324358" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does a fish really need water?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can feel next to impossible to forge the land of motherhood without a reliable diaper bag. This is especially true for moms with busy schedules. When you’re constantly on the move, it’s going to be tough to keep up with the baby’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dirty </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you’re miles away from the comfort of home (and the fancy changing table your aunt picked out from your baby shower registry).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as you love staying home with your baby all day, it’s just not practical for most moms. That’s why the right </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper bag essentials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are going to be a crucial part of mobile motherhood (because as wonderful as your pride and joy may be, no baby is capable of holding it in when nature calls!).</span></p>
<p><b><i>The Bottom Line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yes, you need a diaper bag—one that fits your lifestyle. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Should You Put in a Diaper Bag?</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/copyimage2_8a89b113-f639-4fe3-bdb6-f2d2a2f6fa86.jpg?v=1608324392" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s time to figure out what to put in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">your baby <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/tote-bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tote bag</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While it might be called a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bag, it’s really more like your “everything” bag. Aside from your own personal items, there are a few key things you’ll want to make sure you’ve packed each time you leave the house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a foolproof diaper bag checklist that will have you prepared for any baby bumps in the road:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diapers galore </span><span>– The amount of diapers you pack will usually vary depending on where you’re going. With that in mind, it’s always good to keep </span><i style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></i><span> diapers on hand no matter the situation. On average, most babies need a diaper change every two hours or so. If you keep a solid stash on hand that will last several days, you should be good to go.<br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Soothing rash cream</b><span> – Diaper rash loves popping up at the worst moments, especially when you’re traveling. A long car ride can quickly turn your destination into Rash City, USA. The trick to keeping this </span><i><span>literal</span></i><span> pain in the butt at bay? Always packing rash cream in your diaper bag. Keep a travel-sized tube on hand for fast relief at any time (and to avoid a tear-filled car ride home).<br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Extra clothes</b><span> – Diapers are great—but they’re not exactly an impenetrable force field. Sometimes little accidents can turn into </span><i><span>big </span></i><span>messes. Instead of having to run home every time a diaper fails to do its job, keep an extra change of baby clothes tucked away in your bag! This emergency outfit will save you in times of deep </span><i><span>you know what</span></i><span>—plus, who doesn’t love a mid-day outfit change once in a while? </span><i><span>Work it, baby!<br><br></span></i>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Yummy snacks </span><span>– Your diaper bag isn’t limited to just—well—</span><i style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper</span></i><span>-related things. You’ll want to utilize the zippered pouches as much as possible by packing everything your baby might need throughout the day. A heavy weight item on this list? Snacks, snacks, and more snacks. Obviously, if your baby is still on milk or formula, snacks won’t be necessary just yet. However, if you know your little one tends to get the afternoon munchies, it’s best to prepare for this by throwing a few non-perishable num nums into your diaper bag. And hey, worst case scenario, </span><i style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span> get to eat the snacks if they don’t want them. It’s pretty much a win-win with this one!</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What If Your Bag Can’t Hold Everything?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For larger items that won’t quite fit in your diaper bag, you may need some extra support. Some common examples of additional bags that help carry the rest of your baby load include:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Breast pump bag <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Nursing can be a complicated process, and it typically comes with its own set of must-haves. If all your pumping gadgets and gizmos are infringing on your diaper space, opt for a breast pump bag as well. This will give you a place to store shields, tubing, and even some extra milk bags and bottles </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/4-tips-for-breast-pumping-on-the-go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breast pumping on the go</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Personal tote <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sometimes you don’t want to share. It’s totally normal to bring along your own purse, separate from the diaper bag. If you’re willing to carry both, this can help keep your belongings more organized. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Lunch box <span style="font-weight: 400;">– If you want to bring some cold treats on your outing, a lunchbox is a great option for packing snacks. An insulated lunchbox can also double as a cooler for bottles of milk or formula!</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Diaper bag backpack <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Is a backpack more your style? We’ve got you covered. The BÉIS </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-diaper-bag?_pos=1&amp;_sid=61272aebe&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backpack diaper bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great option for moms who want a more hands-free changing experience. With tons of pockets, adjustable straps, and even an odor-proof pouch for when there’s no trash can in sight for that dirty diaper. This backpack even has pouches for a pacifier and two extra baby bottles, all tucked away in a sleek, stylish design.</span>
</li>
</b><br>
<p><b><i>The Bottom Line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While diapers, wipes, and cream are the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper bag</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essentials, plenty of moms opt for extras, like snacks and clothes. If your diaper pack is getting full, a second bag may be helpful!</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/4_5f4466bb-02df-479c-8b30-6beb9ac1b868.png?v=1619031859" alt="shop beis baby" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Do You Make Diaper Changes Easier On-The-Go?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mastering the art of the quick diaper change is a skill that takes practice—but some handy tips and tools don’t hurt either. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re out and about with your baby, you want to be prepared for any diaper-related emergencies. These </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/11-baby-travel-essentials-every-parent-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby travel essentials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help step up your mom-game, no matter where life takes you.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portable Changing Pad</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be real, most moms can turn any surface into a changing table (in a pinch). Unfortunately, spur of the moment diaper changes can lead to some awkward conversations when you’re in public—like when the restaurant manager reminds you that the table is for eating, not changing. Of course there’s always the public restroom changing tables, but you can never be sure when those were last sanitized—plus, not every destination will even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a restroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where the BÉIS </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-portable-changing-pad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portable Changing Pad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes in handy. With this lightweight pad you’ll be able to whip up a comfortable diaper change no matter where you are. It has a wide layout that gives your baby plenty of room to roll and squirm (though you’d probably prefer they didn’t), and even a built-in pouch for wipes! The best part? It rolls up into a stylish wristlet that can be carried inside your organized diaper bag or on its own.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaper Bag Organizer</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re short on time, the last thing you want is to be rummaging around for lost items (like how pacifiers always seem to disappear when you need them the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">most</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). If you’ve opted to transform your regular purse into a diaper bag, you’ll need a way to keep things organized. After all, most bags aren’t built for baby essentials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is, how does one keep their bag neat when there’s so many things in it? Enter: a tote insert! The BÉIS <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-tote-insert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diaper Bag Organizer</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the perfect solution for moms who want organization, without sacrificing style. Multiple pockets provide the space you need for all your baby’s accessories, both large and small. The insert even comes with a laptop sleeve for the mom who needs to take business on the go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to pair down to a single bag, the tote insert is a great way to make your go-to purse more versatile and baby-friendly!</span></p>
<p><b><i>The Bottom Line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Public diaper changes will go smoother with the right tools. A portable changing pad and bag organizer can lighten your load without leaving you ill-equipped.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elevate Your Diaper Game with BÉIS</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To all the moms who believe style and baby wipes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coexist, BÉIS couldn’t agree with you more!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our wide selection of diaper bags, backpacks, and organizing accessories will have you ready to take on even the toughest changing moments—and look good while doing it. With the right gear, and these packing-savvy tips, you’ll be on your way to having the ultimate changing setup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just remember to pack extra diapers, wipes, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> snacks (for you and your little one). You’ve got this in the bag, mama! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p>Moms seem to do it all. From globetrotting to breastfeeding, life can get pretty hectic when you have a new baby and a packed calendar. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you first start breastfeeding in the privacy of your home, it might not be</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complicated. However, this simplicity often disappears once you start pumping. Between the pads and the tubing, plus more bottles that need to be cleaned than you thought possible—breast pumping can be a pretty intricate part of motherhood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to mention pumping in public, while completely normal, is a new hurdle to cross (although a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-pumping-bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">breast pump bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can make your life a whole lot easier.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a busy schedule and places to be, new moms may feel overwhelmed by this feeding strategy. Don’t worry, this is completely natural. That’s why we put together these four tips, so you can become an expert at breast pumping on the go!</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 How Do You Pump Breast Milk On the Go?</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/copyimage1.jpg?v=1608323353" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of these breastfeeding tips for new moms will cover the basics—how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you pump breast milk when you’re out and about? The best way to facilitate your mobile pumping is by investing in some handy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portable pump </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accessories, such as:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Nursing bra <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Many new moms ditch their uncomfortable underwire for the ease of a nursing</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bra. Why is a nursing bra such a lifesaver for new moms? First and foremost, they have cups that flip down for easy access without taking off your whole bra. Secondly, the material of a nursing bra will keep you comfortable even on your heaviest pumping days. Any mom on the go will find that pumping is much more portable with the right undergarments.</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Pumping bra <span style="font-weight: 400;">– A pumping bra is a little different from a nursing bra. This type of bra is equipped with holes on the cups. Your pump can be hooked up to these holes to extract </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">milk </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">supply </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without revealing your breast at all. This is a great alternative for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pumping </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">moms who want as much privacy as possible when pumping publicly—though they can be a bit more challenging to wear under regular clothing.</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Manual pump <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Electric pumps are great, especially when your arms are tired from holding the baby all day (are newborns </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">supposed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be this heavy?). The downside to these gadgets, however, is that they aren’t very portable. From dying batteries to tangled charging cords, an electric pump won’t always work when you’re out on the town. As a backup, it’s always good to bring a manual pump when traveling. Though they may be a bit harder on your hands, they’re reliable and easily transported.</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Portable cooler <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Does your fridge have more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">milk supply </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bottles than it does condiments? Or did you opt for a separate, mini-fridge that’s just for breast milk? Either way, these handy appliances can’t exactly hit the road with you. That’s where a portable cooler comes in handy. For maximum mobility, you’ll want to pick up something that’s lightweight and insulated—more of a lunchbox than an icebox. This will give you a cool place to store milk when you’re not home.</span>
</li>
</b><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This list isn’t exhaustive. There are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">tons</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of helpful tools that breastfeeding moms can utilize. If you’re looking to step up your pumping game, don’t be afraid to browse for new accessories. Plus, who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs an excuse to do some online shopping?</span></p>
<br>
<p><b><i>The Bottom Line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pumping on the go isn’t always easy. Having the right tools can make a dramatic difference and offer you peace of mind.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 Is it Illegal to Pump in Public?</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/copyimage2.jpg?v=1608323423" alt="" style="float: none;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breastfeeding and pumping are subject to a ton of needless taboo. Something so natural has no place in lawmaking—yet many rules and restrictions still stand in the way of normalizing nursing. Breast pumping mothers want to do what’s best for their child, without receiving a scolding in public (we know, talk about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ridiculous</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, here’s what you need to know about pumping laws:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Public breastfeeding <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Since 1999, federal law has allowed mothers to publicly breastfeed in all fifty states, Washington D.C., the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The specifics of breast </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pumping,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the other hand, is more of a gray area. Most states have laws that protect breastfeeding activities from being considered “public indecency,” but researching the laws for your own state will help you avoid any issues. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Spaces for pumping <span style="font-weight: 400;">– The Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2019 requires many public spaces to offer clean, private areas for new mothers to nurse or pump. These facilities include workplaces, federal buildings, airports, and more. Lactation rooms must be separate from the restroom, and provide a place for mothers to sit comfortably. So, if you’re ever in doubt of whether or not pumping is allowed, always check to see if there’s a designated space for it.</span>

<p><b><i>The Bottom Line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Breastfeeding in public is legal—though there are some questions surrounding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">public pumping </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">session</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you’re feeling uncomfortable, many public places offer lactation rooms where new mothers can pump safely.</span></p>

<h2>#3 Can I Take My Breast Pump On a Plane?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s anyone that gets a little break from the strict TSA guidelines—it’s moms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New moms have a lot on their plate, and even more in their <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/diaper-bags%20">diaper </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/diaper-bags%20">bag</a>.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you are on top of <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-organize-a-diaper-bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to organize a diaper bag</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there’s flexibility with packing when you and your little one are on the go. The following items can be carried onto your flight without causing any security issues (because who has time for a pat down when you’re carrying a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">):</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breast pumps</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 3.4 ounces of breastmilk </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a milk bag</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Larger quantities of milk (that won’t fit in a quart sized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">milk </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bag)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A baby bottle cooler for milk storage</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best tips when it comes to flying with breast pumping gear is to let the TSA agents know beforehand. This will allow for a speedier process and less holdup of the line. Bottles can either be removed from your bag and screened separately, or the entire cooler bag can be sent through the x-ray machine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, security agents may request your permission to open the bottles and inspect their contents. In such a situation, you do have the option to forgo this step and opt for an alternative screening process (though this will be more thorough and take longer). It’s also perfectly legal to travel with larger amounts of breast milk, even if your child is not with you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breast pump—and all its accessories—are considered medical devices and will always be allowed on a plane. During your flight, you’ll be allowed to grab the pump from your carry on and get to work! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because—let’s be honest—breast milk doesn’t wait for the seatbelt sign to turn off.</span></p>
<p><b><i>The Bottom Line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Breastfeeding moms shouldn’t have fear of flying! Pumps, bottles, and other </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/11-baby-travel-essentials-every-parent-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby travel accessories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be packed directly in your carry on.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4 How Do I Pack My Pump Bag?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the O.K. to fly and a booked ticket, only one question remains: What do you carry in your breast pump bag?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packing as a new mom can be tough. Whether you’re flying across the country, or simply driving to the store—the gear you need to bring can feel like you’re preparing to climb Mount Everest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to break down this intimidating task? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take it one step at a time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<b>
<li>Step 1 <span style="font-weight: 400;">– First, you’ll want to pack the essentials. This includes your breast pump</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and any pieces that attach to it. These may include the breast shields, tubes and valves, and any electric parts if applicable. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Step 2 <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Once you’ve finished pumping, you’ll need a place to store the milk. This is where bags and bottles come in handy. The number of containers you bring will depend on how long you’ll be out, but most nursing mothers find that pumping every 2-3 hours does the trick. Storing milk in ziplock bags may save space, but pumping into bottles can save time later—the choice is up to you!</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Step 3 <span style="font-weight: 400;">– The last step to packing your pump bag will focus on the extras. While carrying around </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stuff may not sound appealing, you’d be surprised what a difference the right items can make in terms of comfort. For example, a nursing towel can provide privacy in a pinch and help absorb stray milk droplets to prevent stains on your clothes. Wipes and disinfectants will also come in handy for quicker cleanup after a pumping session. Basically, anything that will help you get back on the move with greater efficiency may be worth packing in your pumping bag!<br><br></span>
</li>
</b>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New moms will need to leave a little extra time when packing. As much as we love our babies, you have to accept that they come with a lot of baggage—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those little cheeks make it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth it.</span></p>
<p><b><i>The Bottom Line:</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pack the basics as well as a few extras to make mobile pumping more comfortable. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make Portable Pumping Stylish with BÉIS</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling doesn’t have to be impossible, even when you’re on a strict pumping schedule. And when you pack with BÉIS, it doesn’t have to be void of style either thanks to these breast pumping tips and tricks. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're expecting a long flight, sometimes checked baggage can save you the headache. But you may be wondering what to bring in a carry on to fulfill your travel needs, while also following TSA and airline guidelines </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saving space in your <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel bag</a>. </span></p>

<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What To Pack in a Carry On... Depends on the Carry On!  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people shy away from packing a carry on bag because they’re afraid it won’t hold all the things they want to bring. While it’s true that there is a maximum capacity for carry-ons, it’s actually much larger than you may think even though it fits in an overhead bin. Anything from a tote bag to a medium-sized suitcase can be classified as a carry-on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For shorter trips, sometimes this is the only bag you need to bring if you know how to pack it correctly. So whether you’re sporting a fun little purse or full-blown luggage, let’s take a look at what you’ll want to put inside your carry on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/10-reasons-why-traveling-is-important-for-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why traveling is important</a> but now that you know the best way to pack a carry on you might be wondering what to bring in a hardside carry on. It often depends on where you’re going and for how long. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tote bag or Purse</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who are either packing light or have most of their belongings in a checked bag, bringing a <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/tote-bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tote bag or purse</a> on the plane is a perfect way to ensure all your essentials are accessible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get the most out of this small carry on, you’ll want to choose a bag that has multiple pockets without compromising on style—you’re going to be strutting around the airport holding this, there’s no reason it can’t look nice! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-work-tote-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work Tote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example. With two external pockets, a padded laptop sleeve, and a removable zip pouch for smaller items, there’s room for everything you need and more. Plus, it’s sleek, fashionable, and pairs well with almost any outfit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s time to get down to the nitty-gritty: What do you put in all these pockets? These pockets are a lifesaver for the traveler who is packing light. For a carry on bag this small, it’s important that you pick only the most essential items. This leaves some room for personal preference, but some examples of what you may reach for during a flight include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laptop and phone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye mask</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portable chargers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A book or magazine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earplugs or earbuds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wallet and passport</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keys (the our</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-work-tote-in-black"> </a><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-work-tote-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Work Tote</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has its own key fob so you don’t lose them!)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these items will fit comfortably in a tote-sized carry on, and the right amount of pockets will ensure nothing gets lost or cluttered if you hit any unexpected turbulence. </span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backpack</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step up from a tote bag carry-on is a <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backpack</a>. Choosing to bring a backpack on a plane is great because it holds more than a purse, but—unlike a suitcase—can typically still be stored under your seat while still holding all your travel essentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing the perfect carry on backpack, it’s important to find a balance of sleekness and storage. While a bulky backpack may fit a lot of items, you don’t want it so big that it can’t fit comfortably in a tight space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags/products/the-2-in-1-backpack-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2-in-1 backpack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fits the bill on this one. With a convenient front pocket, removable pouch, and spacious interior with a 15” laptop sleeve, it’s surprising how much you can fit in this do-it-all backpack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this storage space may have you wondering what to bring (we know; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the possibilities are endless</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Similar to a tote bag, a classic and stylish backpack such as a <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-rucksack-in-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rucksack</a> allows you to have easy access to essential items like your phone, toiletries, or a book. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Packing Tip -</strong> Additionally, you can also fit items such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sweatshirt in case the plane is chilly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Laptop bag </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hand Sanitizer to keep any unwanted germs away </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A water bottle or another beverage you purchased at the airport</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any cosmetic items you might need to freshen up</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larger, over the ear headphones</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any valuables you don’t want in a checked bag</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A backpack leaves more room for any additional items you want to keep close by, including bulkier items that won’t fit in your tote bag like a travel pillow. If you plan on packing a bit heavier, a backpack may be the way to go.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-hanging-jewelry-case?_pos=1&amp;_sid=8a18d2430&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="hanging jewelry case" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/body_image_1.jpg?v=1605784974" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry On Suitcase</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final evolution of carry on luggage is the hardside suitcase. Choosing a suitcase as your carry on can sometimes be a gamble, even if you’re not flying to Las Vegas. Oftentimes, it’s difficult to determine whether or not your suitcase fits the exact dimensions of a carry on prior to arriving at the airport.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, at BÈIS we carry a line of hardside luggage specifically designed for carry-on purposes. Our</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-carry-on-roller-in-beige"> </a><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-carry-on-roller-in-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21” Carry On Roller suitcase</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will fit perfectly in any overhead compartment and eliminates the fear of a potential checked bag fee. The Carry On Roller suitcase comes with easy glide 360° spinner wheels, tons of luggage space, a cushioned handle, and even an indicator window that will light up red if you surpass 50 lbs when packing (no battery required)!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a carry on suitcase, you have the opportunity to ditch a checked bag entirely, even when packing for a longer trip. A rolling bag can be easier on your shoulders too! In a carry on suitcase, one packing tip is bringing along items such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clothes (we recommend using packing cubes)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toiletries (that follow TSA and airport security guidelines)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronics</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extra pair of shoes</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, anything that fits in your suitcase and is allowed inside a carry-on can be packed in this form of luggage. Sometimes opting for a larger carry-on instead of a checked bag is a great way to save time and money on baggage fees. Don't forget to create your carry on packing list beforehand so you don't forget any travel essentials. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/beis-cosmetic-case-beige" target="_blank" title="beige cosmetic case" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/body_image_2.jpg?v=1605785021" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">TSA Guidelines</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When packing for a flight, it’s important to understand the TSA rules and regulations regarding what items you can bring. Checked bags typically offer a little more leeway when it comes to packing restrictions. If you’re planning on bringing a carry-on bag, it’s vital to remember these guidelines:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Containers of liquids or creams must contain 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All liquid items must fit in a 1 quart, clear plastic bag</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A maximum of 1-quart bag is allowed per passenger</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronics must be removed from your bag during TSA screening</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No food that isn’t purchased at the airport, post-screening</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No weapons, explosives, or sharp objects</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TSA has a long list of prohibited and accepted items, so always remember to double-check online if you’re ever unsure about bringing something in your carry on.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Moms Should Pack In Their Carry On</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite extensive restrictions for carry-on items, TSA understands the fact that babies have certain needs that can’t be put on hold because of a flight. This means you don't have to go through the hassle of putting all your child's necessities in your checked luggage.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The following items are perfectly acceptable to bring in your carry on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby formula and breast milk (3.4 ounces or less)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby wipes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diapers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby powder</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby carrier</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a mom searching for the perfect baby-friendly carry-on, look no further than our functional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-diaper-bag-in-black"> </a><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-diaper-bag-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diaper Bag</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

This stylish bag comes equipped with tons of pockets to fit essentials for you and your little one. The diaper bag even comes with a built-in teething ring to help avoid any mid-flight meltdowns, especially during a long flight.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What About Mile High Diaper Changes?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For baby luggage on the lighter side, try our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-portable-changing-pad?_pos=1&amp;_sid=8b1aaf7b2&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changing Organizer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabo, Mexico</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Cabo_Mexico.jpg?v=1605783795" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the beachy bachelorette looking to leave the U.S., Cabo is one of the best places to throw a bachelorette party filled with sun, sand, and celebration. Whether you want to relax by the ocean, rent a yacht or enjoy a roof top bar, pool party, sip on a beachy cocktail on one of Cabo's pristine beaches, or a little bit of both, here are some of the best bachelorette activities in Cabo!</span></p>
<b>
<li>Book a stay at the Grand Solmar <span style="font-weight: 400;">– One of the nicest resorts in all of Cabo San Lucas, the Grand Solmar is the epitome of luxury and ocean views. The hotel also offers an all-inclusive package, which comes with gourmet meals, golfing, and even whale watching. This resort also has amenities such as an adult-only pool, full spa, bars and restaurants, and even a private beach. You can also rent a luxury villa in San Jose del Cabo and hire a private chef and driver if you want your bachelorette party group to all be in the same house. <br><br></span>
</li>
</b><b>
<li>Happy Ending Cantina <span style="font-weight: 400;">– For the bride who wants to throw it back to her college days, the Happy Ending Cantina has everything you need. Beer pong, a dance floor, and $5.00 beer and shot combos are all served up at this rowdy venue.  </span>

</b><br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake Tahoe, California</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Lake_Tahoe_California.jpg?v=1605783886" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not every bachelorette wants to celebrate their upcoming ceremony in the sweltering heat with their bride tribe, and that’s okay. For brides who want the ground as white as their wedding gown (winter wedding anyone?), try hitting the slopes of Lake Tahoe! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Situated in the Sierra Nevada mountains, this perfect destination is a surprising winter wonderland in the heart of California. For fun activities to include in a subzero Lake Tahoe bachelorette party, try some of these ideas:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Skiing and snowboarding <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Book a room at one of Lake Tahoe's lavish ski resorts, or split the cost of a rental house for more privacy. The proximity to the slopes will let you and your friends fill the days with exciting winter sports. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Turn up the heat at night <span style="font-weight: 400;">– A snowy bachelorette party destination doesn’t have to mean ditching the nightlife. Southern Lake Tahoe has a busy bar scene with tons of fun spots to choose from. Heavenly Mountain offers a live DJ for partying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the slopes, and Montbleu Casino brings a little slice of Vegas to the mountains for a rowdier bachelorette vibe.</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Relax with a spa day <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Recover from the chilly temperatures outside with a nice, hot spa day at Stillwater Spa. This spa offers a ton of packages perfect for a bachelorette party. From massages to manicures and even a boozy brunch, you’ll be feeling completely recharged after a long day of skiing. </span>
</li>
</b><br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tulum, Mexico</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Tulum_Mexico.jpg?v=1605783955" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another destination for a bride-to-be who wants </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">south of the border, Tulum has a killer nightlife that’s bound to be memorable (or not…if you know what we mean). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With close proximity to gorgeous beaches, the jungle and Mayan ruins, Tulum is the perfect place for a Mexico bachelorette party that requires wild energy. Some of the best ideas for a Tulum, Mexico bachelorette bash include:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Gitano <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Gitano is a popular beach bar in Tulum that has a live DJ every Friday night. The cost of entry is totally free, and artisanal cocktails are served all night long. While this bar has locations in Miami and New York, the Tulum spot is the place to be for special events. Bachelorettes can also choose to make a reservation and book a private party at this joint for an experience exclusive to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">them</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">!<br><br></span></span>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/3.png?v=1619029886" alt="shop luggage accessories" style="float: none;"></a></div>
</li>
</b><br><b>

Customers can even book more adventurous outings—like water sports and jungle tours—if they’re feeling brave enough. </span>
</li>
</b><br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Las Vegas, Nevada</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Las_Vegas_Nevada.jpg?v=1605784024" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sin City is a classic choice for the perfect bachelorette party destination, but there’s more to this getaway than slot machines and Penn &amp; Teller shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene in Vegas has evolved over the years, and bachelorettes who choose to celebrate on the strip can find a much wider variety of activities now than ever before. </span></p>
<b>
<li>A pool party like no other <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Las Vegas may be known for casinos, but another popular bachelorette activity involves hitting up the daytime pool parties. Many hotels and clubs offer pool parties, and an entry fee will typically get you unlimited drinks and pool time. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Get a helicopter tour <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Celebrate in the sky with one of Las Vegas’ exciting helicopter tours! Starting at $89, you can see the bright lights of the strip from thousands of feet above. Up to six people can enjoy this high-flying tour, so choose wisely who you’re bringing along if this is an activity that interests you.</span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Take a pole dancing class <span style="font-weight: 400;">– This one is for the bold bride-to-be. Stripper 101 is a pole dancing class that will teach you these sexy moves for a starting price of $24. Laugh with your friends as you all try to maneuver the pole, and maybe even pick up a move or two for after the wedding!

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napa Valley, California</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Napa_Valley_California.jpg?v=1605784086" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What bride doesn’t love a good glass of wine? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get your fix in now before you risk a cabernet stain on your wedding dress by spending a bachelorette weekend in Napa Valley, California. For some fun ideas on how to spice up a weekend getaway in wine country, try out these perfect bachelorette outings that your bridal party will love:</span></p>
<b>
<li>Take the Napa Valley Wine Tour <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Get a private tour of Napa Valley in a luxury vehicle for $1,200. This activity involves four to five hours of wine tasting for up to 12 people, learning interesting facts about winemaking, and a ride in a limousine or party bus! Don’t worry about finding a designated driver, either. The tour includes a safe ride back to your hotel at the end of the tastings. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Ride the Wine Train <span style="font-weight: 400;">– For a cheaper alternative to the wine tour (with a fun twist), try taking the Napa Valley Wine Train. For $233, you get to try wines from all over Napa, eat a gourmet lunch, and feel like a high-class train passenger from the industrial revolution. </span>
</li>
</b><br><b>
<li>Reserve a winery wine tasting <span style="font-weight: 400;">– If you’re looking to avoid post-wine motion sickness, try reserving a spot at one of Napa Valley’s 500 wineries. Most wineries and vineyards accept reservations for larger groups, so your NAPA bachelorette party will have plenty of time to sit down, relax, and try some delicious vino!</span>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve spent any time swiping on dating apps, you’ve probably noticed a theme: everyone</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> loves</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traveling (along with brunch and long walks on the beach). And if traveling isn’t already your Tinder match’s favorite pastime, it’s probably on their bucket list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is this? Well, traveling </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to a new destination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one thing that actually lives up to the hype (unlike many dating apps). By planning a trip, you can set yourself up for many surprising benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best of all, traveling doesn’t need to break the bank. There’s an abundance of cheap flights, affordable accommodations, and cute, cost-effective <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luggage</a> options out there to make your next adventure possible. Before you Google “<a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/genius-packing-tips-you-wish-you-knew-earlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel packing tips</a>,” learn why a new experience in a different place could be just what you need.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Traveling Is Important</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're wondering why you should travel, check out these 10 benefits</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of traveling:</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Traveling Offers You a Healthy Escape</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many people, the purpose of travel is to enjoy some much-needed relaxation. Sometimes, you just need a break from everything going on in your life, whether that’s:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work stress</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bad breakup</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gloomy weather</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boredom</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of why you’re craving an escape, travel is the ticket. It’s amazing how small your problems look when you're 40,000 feet up in the sky, gazing down at them from a tiny plane window. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi problems… Bye problems.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On your vacation, you can indulge in a much-deserved reprieve. Maybe you spend your off-time soaking up the sun on a tropical beach somewhere, the sound of waves lapping, and a piña colada in hand (let's be honest, piña coladas could be the sole reason why traveling is important). Or maybe perusing Parisian art museums all afternoon is more your style. No matter how you choose to relax and unwind, taking a break from your responsibilities is healthy! It allows you to return home with a renewed sense of energy. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/2_0a993aa4-416e-463b-a4e6-f9bd6a7daf06.png?v=1623324292" alt="shop luggage" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Traveling Helps You Grow as a Person</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever hear the saying, “there’s no growth in your comfort zone”? Well, it’s true. If you’re currently stuck in a rut, traveling can help you shake free from stagnation and jumpstart your personal growth journey. Once you set foot in a new city or country, you’ll be given plenty of opportunities to challenge yourself by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating unfamiliar situations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> language</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting new people from diverse cultures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tasting new, daring cuisines (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">escargot, anyone?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signing up for thrilling activities, like skydiving, ziplining, or horseback riding</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By venturing out of your comfort zone, you'll gain a fresh perspective </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and new ideas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on your preferences, goals, and values. You'll be able to see beyond the limitations of your day-to-day life and uncover what truly matters to you.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a life-changing revelation with a change of scenery.</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-everyday-backpack-in-sakura-pink?_pos=1&amp;_sid=a12d5c189&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="pink backpack" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/1-change_of_scenery_480x480.jpg?v=1605696031" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></i></a></p>
<br><br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Traveling Offers You Immersive, Real-World Learning Experiences</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling can also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bishopjordan/2017/09/05/science-says-travel-makes-you-smarter/?sh=4f6f917f719a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make you smarter</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you had a trip to Peru on the books, you might feel inspired to brush up on your Spanish or read up on the history of Machu Picchu. Once you arrive, all of those lessons will become much more memorable and salient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, traveling transforms the world into your classroom. There’s a reason why so many colleges promote study abroad programs. Even if you embark on your vacation for relaxation’s sake, you can still pick up culinary tips, spiritual practices, and problem-solving skills along the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling also helps you dispel any preconceptions you have about other countries and cultures. If your only exposure to a foreign country is what you hear on the news, you could have an overly-negative perception of it. By booking a trip and checking it out for yourself, you’ll see first-hand what it has to offer, allowing you to develop a more accurate (and positive) perspective on the world. </span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Traveling Enhances Your Understanding of Other Cultures</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/the-importance-of-understanding-different-cultures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding different cultures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a reason to travel all on its own. It’s fascinating how diverse different cultures can be, from their pace of life to their long-held traditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By immersing yourself in a new culture, you’ll reevaluate your assumptions about how life must be lived. Maybe you notice that you savor the slow pace of “island time” in Hawaii. Or maybe you’re invigorated by the lively nightlife of Buenos Aires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By experiencing a different culture and other values, you’ll learn why traveling is important by discovering there are many ways to live.</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Traveling Deepens Your Connection to Humanity at Large</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many cultures showcase rich diversity, being in a new place, and discovering new things also reveals to you that people aren’t that different from one another. We all share a common humanity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter where you travel, people:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work hard for their families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aspire to give their children a better life</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have similar hopes, fears, and dreams</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy celebrations, music, and great food</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This unified sense of humanity will help you cultivate more empathy for those who are different than you, whether they live at home or abroad. </span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Traveling Allows You to Try New Cuisines</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a foodie, traveling can take your taste buds’ on the experience of their lifetime. There’s nothing like visiting a new country to expand your culinary horizons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine sitting down to a fresh plate of homemade Italian pasta from a family-owned “trattoria.” They’ve been perfecting their craft for hundreds of years. One bite in, you'll discover the purpose of travel and be lost in spaghetti heaven. Or maybe you try out some authentic Japanese sushi or Mexican food South of the border—after experiences like these, you’ll have a whole new appreciation for their cultures of origin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you eat your way through your destination, you may even pick up a few tips and tricks to enhance your kitchen at home! There’s no better way to impress a dinner date than with some “authentic” cuisine inspired by your travels. </span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Traveling Connects You with New People</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling also gives you the opportunity to meet some new friends! As a traveler, you have a perfect excuse to start up a conversation with locals. All you have to do is ask them about the best things to do in their city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you meet some </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">friendly locals, they may even offer to show you around. You could end up exploring the hidden treasures and “locals-only” hot spots of your travel destination. Even if you’re on the shyer side, traveling has a way of forcing people out of their shells (in the best of ways, of course).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By developing friendships with</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">people abroad, you’ll return home with an international social network—and possibly even an invitation to visit again soon!</span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Traveling Lets You Build Meaningful Memories with Loved Ones</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we know you're discovering, there are many reasons to travel and while solo </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is all the rave these days </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(especially for young people)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, family travel or going with friends is equally valuable. It gives you and your loved ones a chance to make memories that you'll look back on for years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From long travel days spent hauling your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the airport to unforgettable afternoons traversing a new country, group trips promote a special type of bond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re planning a romantic getaway with your new spouse or a big family bash abroad, or wondering what the <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/10-reasons-why-traveling-is-important-for-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best bachelorette party destinations</a> are, you can rest assured that you’ll leave your vacation closer with your travel-mates than you were when you arrived.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-carry-on-roller-in-sakura-pink" target="_blank" title="light pink carry-on luggage" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/2-memories_480x480.jpg?v=1605696063" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></a></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Traveling Can Make You More Attractive</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it’s true, posting a photo from your trip to Bali increases your dating app matches by 300%. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s science. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All jokes aside, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that traveling makes you more dateable and desirable. Here’s why:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll have tons of captivating stories to tell</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll exude a newfound sense of confidence</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be more open-minded due to your exposure to other cultures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll possess a unique perspective on the world </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a well-traveled person, you inherently become more interesting. Others will see your travels as an indication that you’re adventurous, open-minded, and confident. By embodying this magical travel charisma, you’ll attract like-minded love interests and show them that you’re up for some adventure. </span></p>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Traveling Amplifies Your Appreciation for Home</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distance makes the heart grow fonder. This sentiment certainly applies to your hometown after a long stint abroad. Even if you cherish every moment in a foreign country and experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world’s i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ncredible cultural diversity </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and cultural traditions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there's something deliciously comforting about returning home </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to everyday life.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling with babies can be stressful and requires prime organization. Wondering what to bring? Read on for a list of baby travel essentials!</span><p><a class="read-more" href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/11-baby-travel-essentials-every-parent-needs">More</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p>When you’re traveling with a baby, you know there’s a lot out of your control—how your precious bundle will adjust to turbulence, noise, and time changes, for starters. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides these unknowns, your goal is to prepare for getting through security, onto your plane, and through your flight with the arsenal of things that keep your baby or little ones calm and happy, from fresh diapers to soothing toys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news? The right </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing checklist </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can help you avoid that moment of panic when you can't find the specific pacifier </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/11-baby-travel-essentials-every-parent-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that always stops tears in their tracks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is our list of 11 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby travel essentials</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must haves that can help you be prepared and organized for your baby's needs so that you can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enjoy your adventure. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-diaper-bag-in-black" target="_blank" title="black diaper bag" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/reg_diaper_480x480.jpg?v=1603998883" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 Car Seat/Booster Seat</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you set foot on the plane, you have to make it to the airport. If you aren’t a car-owner, you could try requesting an Uber or Taxi with a baby seat—but wouldn’t you rather have a seat at hand, one with safety specs you know you can trust?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why an infant car seat is #1 on our list of baby travel essentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you already use a convertible stroller with a detachable car bassinet and car seat, you’re all set. However, if your baby spends most of their time strapped to your chest, you’ll want to invest in a lightweight, functional car seat just for your trip to comply with the law and maintain peace of mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.gracobaby.com/car-seats/infant-car-seats/snugride-snuglock-35-lx-featuring-trueshield-technology/SAP_2053220.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graco SnugRide® SnugLock® 35 LX</a><a href="https://www.gracobaby.com/car-seats/infant-car-seats/snugride-snuglock-35-lx-featuring-trueshield-technology/SAP_2053220.html"> </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">car seat, which combines several sought-after features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightweight</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easy to install</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your little ones safe on their trip to the airport, and cross your fingers that they’ll snooze underneath the canopy of your travel stroller while you pass through security. </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#2 A Functional and Stylish Diaper Bag</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-backpack-diaper-bag" target="_blank" title="black diaper bag backpack" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/backpack_480x480.jpg?v=1603998892" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You already have a go-to diaper bag so that you’re prepared when your baby does their business while you’re over at a friend’s or out shopping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is it organized enough for smooth sailing during travel days?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re on the lookout for the best baby travel bags, there’s no better time to buy than before your first big trip with your baby or toddler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At BÈIS, we’ve designed 2 types of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper bags</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-backpack-diaper-bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaper Bag Backpack</span></a>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-diaper-bag-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaper Bag Tote</span></a>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some parents prefer the convenience of being hands free with a backpack, while others prefer the easy access to baby essentials that a tote provides by slipping it down their shoulder. Whatever design best suits your needs, here are some of our favorite features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Plenty of pockets</b> <b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– With dedicated compartments for wipes and diapers as well as a detachable odor-proof pouch for a dirty diaper, it’s easy to store your essentials </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any waste on-hand (until you can find a trash can). There’s even a pacifier pouch and bottle pocket(s)!</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Different sets of straps </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– An adjustable strap makes it easy to customize your travel bag’s look and functionality. Strap either bag to your baby’s stroller and make changes on-the-go to suit the setting.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<b>
<li>A luggage slip-on panel<span style="font-weight: 400;"> – When you’re traveling, you have your hands full—literally. Slip one of these stylish <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/diaper-bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diaper bags</a> onto your carry-on luggage, roll, and go.</span>
</li>
</b>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best feature of all? These baby bags for air travel don’t scream “diaper bags.” You’ll feel like you’ve got one of the most stylish baby bags on the whole plane. They’re elegant enough to go wherever you’re going—even a night off from mommy duty.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#3 Portable Changing Organizer</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-portable-changing-pad" target="_blank" title="portable changing organizer" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/portable_480x480.jpg?v=1603998920" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, it’s easy to find a restroom with a changing table. Other times, you’re unfolding your denim jacket and hoping against all odds that this diaper change won’t result in a permanent stain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say goodbye to this concern with a collapsible, liquid-proof, and easy-to-wipe-down </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-portable-changing-pad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">portable changing pad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This changing mat is a padded, protected and comfortable mat for your newborn or toddler. It’s compact, lightweight and even has pockets for diapers and wipes to make changing a breeze. That’s why it’s earned a prime spot on our list of best baby travel gear.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#4 Wet Wipes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Need we say more?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wet wipes are some of the most essential baby travel items out there for cleaning up everything from spills to spit-up. In a pinch, you can stash used wipes in your diaper bag’s odor-proof pouch. </span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/4_2dd4ee97-85c6-4cdd-b62f-27786366529c.png?v=1623325037" alt="shop beis baby" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#5 Travel Stroller</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need a stroller to keep your baby cozy as you hit up the attractions on your vacation adventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it’s your first time traveling with an infant, you may be concerned about getting your stroller through security and onto a plane. Thankfully, airline attendants can help your family get through early boarding without a hassle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the right stroller can make </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life easier.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.besrey.com/home/product/detail.html?name=BR-C705S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BABYZEN Yoyo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is lightweight and collapsible. This lightweight stroller has reached cult status for a reason—it folds and unfolds within instants, and you can even carry it over your shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With options for newborns and older babies, invest in this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lightweight stroller </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and keep using it as your child grows.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#6 Stroller Caddy</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-stroller-caddy" target="_blank" title="stroller caddy" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/stroller_cad_480x480.jpg?v=1603999151" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your essentials at your fingertips with an adjustable stroller caddy. Designed to easily clip on to any stroller with a stroller strap, our <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-stroller-caddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stroller caddy</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is incredibly versatile. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has an interior pocket designed specifically for bottles and offers spacious mesh compartments for your burp cloth, snacks, a change of clothes, or extra diaper storage.<br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zippered compartments are a perfect fit for your phone, keys, wallet, and other essentials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes with an adjustable shoulder strap to carry cross-body.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s never been easier to get off the plane, open your stroller, and keep your essentials at the ready.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#7 Bottle Cooler</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-bottle-cooler" target="_blank" title="bottler cooler" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/bottle_cool_480x480.jpg?v=1603999141" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to keep your breast milk safe and your little one</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">content during long and potentially uncomfortable voyages?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have plenty of food on-hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, having a ready backup supply of food can make it easier to feed your baby when it’s convenient for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (i.e., not when you’re waiting in line at passport control).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter our stylish </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-bottle-cooler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bottle cooler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This insulated bottle holder is a travel must-have and includes ice packs, making it easy to keep your baby bottle(s) cool.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#8 Silicone Bibs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downside of keeping travel snacks at the ready? You know a mess is inevitable, and the last thing you want to do is change your tot’s jumper in a confined space!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bibs are a perennial favorite amongst on the go items for babies. But if you usually use cloth bibs, you probably aren’t looking forward to doing laundry on vacation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ingenious solution? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A silicone bib</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you place one of these on your baby, you know their outfit will make it through mealtime and burping.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use one of those handy wet-wipes to clean off the silicone bib.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, place it back in your liquid-safe baby diaper bag!</span></li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#9 Sleep Sack</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's almost impossible to predict the temperature on planes. That's why our list of baby flight essentials includes something to keep your</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> little munchkin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warm!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren’t already using a </span><a href="https://www.halosleep.com/halo-sleepsack-wearable-blanket-100-cotton-blue-wb-cot-blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wearable blanket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during nap time, now is a great time to start. A sleep sack is safe for your baby, and inverted zippers make it easy to take the sack on and off for diaper changes and temperature adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, you won’t have to worry about the complexities of swaddling while you deal with everything else on your tray-table! </span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#10 Pumping Bag</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-pumping-bag" target="_blank" title="breast pumping bag" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/breastpump_480x480.jpg?v=1603998904" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best baby travel accessories ensure a smooth and comfortable travel experience for baby and mom. That’s why we created a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-pumping-bag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pumping bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make your life that much easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transporting your breast pump shouldn't be a hassle and you shouldn't have to sacrifice style for functionality or comfort. Our pumping bag doubles as a work bag with a laptop sleeve and a pocket just for mom. With features like a separate bag for clean and dirty </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clothes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a water resistant pocket, you can feel confident that your bag will stay clean and all your items will be safe.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#11 Portable Crib</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond flight essentials for baby, it’s important to think ahead to your hotel. Once you arrive at your destination, you’ll want to start unpacking and get comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that really possible with a hotel crib?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you can’t bring your whole crib on most trips, a portable crib can create a sleep environment that you can fully trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.babybjorn.com/baby-cradle-and-travel-crib/travel-crib-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby Bjorn travel crib</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earns high marks for the following features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comfy mattress</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highly collapsible</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel bag included</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deluxe safety features</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breathable material</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hope this travel crib will let your whole family rest easier.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t Forget Your Own Travel Essentials</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you have the best travel items for baby to ensure your little one has everything they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you say the same for yourself?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, babies are more perceptive than we can imagine. If you’re stressed carrying your brand-new <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-diaper-bag-in-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baby bag</a> on top of the janky suitcase you’ve been rolling around since college, it could have an effect on you both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, if going through security is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">extra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chaotic while you fumble to find your TSA-approved 3-1-1 liquid bag, it can impact the entire trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you're </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/vacation-ideas-tips-for-traveling-with-toddlers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traveling with toddlers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or embarking on a trip with a newborn, you should prepare your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">own</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> luggage with the same love and care you extend to your little </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">munchkin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! So make sure that baby on the go items aren't the only things on your packing list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/genius-packing-tips-you-wish-you-knew-earlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing tip</span><b>s</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that you can make zipping up your own suitcase a well-organized, calm affair. (And if you don’t have the bandwidth, be sure to ask your partner or a friend for a helping hand.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, you and baby can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> get a little R&amp;R when you reach your destination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With today’s TSA restrictions, making it through security with each and every product can be quite a feat. And beyond the risk of confiscation, you don’t want to end up with a concealer or your go-to curl cream ruining half the clothes you’ve packed in your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="travel bag"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you make sure your deodorant, sunscreen, and makeup all arrive at their final destination? Don’t sweat it! We’ve assembled this guide on how to pack toiletries and makeup so that you can pack your essentials without worrying about TSA requirements, spills, or space.</span></p>

<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Get Started, Survey Your Toiletries</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you wondering how to pack makeup for air travel? First things first—size matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to carry-on, you’re restricted in both the size of your toiletries and in the total amount of liquid, gel, and cream you carry on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TSA </span><a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/what-3-1-1-liquids-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the “3-1-1 liquids rule” as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are allowed to bring a quart-sized bag of liquids, aerosols, gels, creams and pastes through the checkpoint. These are limited to 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is it called the 3-1-1 rule? Each passenger is allowed:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.4 oz items</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1 quart-sized plastic bag</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 bag allowed per passenger</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This translates to about nine 3-oz items (since there are 32 oz in a quart). To break it down further, 3-oz items are those travel-size </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bathroom items, or reusable bottles, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found at most convenience stores. However, depending on the size of each container or liquids bag , you may have room for a few more or less toiletries.</span></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/3.png?v=1619029886" alt="shop luggage accessories" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news? You can also place additional full- and travel-sized liquids in any luggage you’re checking. </span></p>

While you hope checked luggage will be at baggage claim when you arrive, something can always go wrong. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you arrive at your destination without toothpaste</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or toothbrush!)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it's easy enough to buy a tube, or even use the complimentary option in your hotel. But going a few days without your favorite makeup and moisturizer is a little more inconvenient. And if your suitcase goes missing permanently , you could lose hundreds of dollars worth of cosmetics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you decide what to carry on and what to pack, the next step is learning how to organize toiletries in your luggage </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> risking spills.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize Space With Travel Size, Refillables and Solids</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you narrowed down the list of what you need to pack in your 1-quart carry-on bag?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel like you have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as many cosmetics as can fit, you’re not alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out how to economize space by bringing only the products you need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More manufacturers than ever now put their perfumes, CC creams, and smoothing balms in TSA-compliant 3.4 oz containers. However, you may not really need 3.4 oz for a short overnight trip. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-hanging-cosmetic-case?_pos=7&amp;_sid=8833ec563&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="hanging cosmetic case" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Hacks_1_480x480.jpg?v=1602524289" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try a few different strategies to make sure each product is as petite as possible:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Invest in travel-sized products </span>– It’s easy to get a teensy tube of toothpaste or mouthwash to take with you during travel. There are also a travel-sized skincare product options.</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch from liquid to solid</span> – Solid perfume, facial soap, makeup remover (makeup wipes), and even shampoo and conditioner can be your best friends when it comes to travel toiletries. Every solid item you bring is one less liquid in your quart sized bag—and one less goopy spill to worry about in your luggage. Just be sure to place any solid toiletries in a plastic bag of their own to avoid residue on your clothes.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Try refillable containers</span> – It’s easier than ever to find chic, refillable containers to deposit a smidge of your sunscreen or perfume. Made of soft silicone and other spill-proof materials, you’ll never have to worry about a fancy glass bottle breaking again!<b> <br><br></b>
</li>
<li>Now that you’ve downsized your collection, you’re ready to stash it in your luggage!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pack Your Carry-On</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, you know exactly what you’re going to put in your hand luggage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what are you going to put it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us have gotten away with putting a regular, old makeup bag jam-packed with liquids through security. However, there’s nothing worse than finding you’re in a security line with sticklers who rifle through your non-compliant bag in great detail, swabbing and scanning every item. This could delay your connection or even make you miss your flight!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's why you need a travel toiletry </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">kit </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that contains a reusable, TSA-compliant clear pouch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hanging </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/makeup-cosmetic-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosmetic travel bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is perfect for the traveler who needs to pack </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her cosmetics for the weekend away. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed for ladies who want to keep their hair, skin, and makeup on point, the BÈIS hanging </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toiletry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bag features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>A unique hanging design</b><span> – use the hanger to set up your case in your hotel room and enjoy the next best thing to your medicine cabinet. </span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">TSA-complaint pouch</span><span> –</span>Pop this clear bag out of your carry-on at a moment's notice to make sure your travel-size <span style="font-weight: 400;">liquid</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toiletries get through the security checkpoint in the blink of an eye.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Three compartments</span><span> – It’s easy to stash powdered makeup, hairbrushes, and more in your makeup case alongside your liquid cosmetics. Use the compartments to spread out and see all the components of your beauty routine at once.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p> <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-hanging-cosmetic-case?_pos=7&amp;_sid=8833ec563&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="beige cosmetic case" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Hacks_2_480x480.jpg?v=1602524330" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organize Your Checked Bag</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may need to place any cosmetic overflow into your checked luggage. Besides, if you’re going on a long trip, it makes perfect sense to take full-size versions of your contact solution, shampoo, body wash, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to make sure they don’t leak all over your clothes, requiring you to invest in a dry cleaner (or maybe a whole new wardrobe) when you arrive!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try these <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/genius-packing-tips-you-wish-you-knew-earlier" title="luggage packing tips">luggage </a></span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/genius-packing-tips-you-wish-you-knew-earlier" title="luggage packing tips"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to avoid dreaded spills:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Maximize space from the get-go</span><span>. Do you have to sit on your luggage to get it closed? There’s a better way. Use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-packing-cubes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-weight: bold;" title="packing cubes">packing cubes</a> </span>to compress and organize your clothing into neat squares and rectangles so that you're not squeezing your hair <span style="font-weight: 400;">product </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">between your heels and leather jacket. Using a packing cube to group certain clothes together also makes finding the perfect outfit that much easier at your destination!<br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cover the opening</span><span>. We know—your cosmetics already </span><i style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span> lids. But you can add another layer of protection by opening each bottle and placing a piece of flexible saran wrap underneath it. Be sure not to stretch it too tightly, so there’s a little room for the liquid to expand. Trust us: losing a little bit of product in the plastic wrap is much better than risking an all-out explosion in your travel bag!<br><br></span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Buy a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/beis-dopp-kit-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-weight: bold;" title="dopp kit">dopp kit</a><span>. The best way to pack toiletries in a suitcase is to place them in a leak-proof bag. A zippered bag with sturdy sides ensures that spillage will never make its way into your suitcase. Our dopp kit excels in the hotel room, too. Place it on the bathroom vanity or use the snap-loop to hang it from your towel rod, so you never have to worry about your favorite vacation perfume cascading from the narrow sink.</span><b> <br> </b>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel Light, Travel Smart and Enjoy Your Trip</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overpacking is incredibly tempting. When you’re visiting a new city, you might feel like you need a full arsenal of hair products—mousse, pomade, hairspray, the works—not to mention every eyeshadow in your collection so you can make sure your look matches your mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We completely sympathize!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, there's nothing more stressful than having to throw out products to make it through security, or realizing you need to check an extra bag for your return flight after you've purchased one too many products on your trip! Set yourself up for success and make a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toiletries packing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> list before you start packing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid the temptation to stash nail polish, lip balm and face serums in the little pockets of your suitcase. Pack your toiletries in a TSA-approved </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">toiletries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bag </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or ziplock bag</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that's easily accessible from your carry on bag. If there's anything that won't fit, you'll just have to treat yourself to a manicure or blow-out on your trip, won't you? Now that's how you start a trip.</span></p>
<br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress-Free Travel with BÈIS</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embarking on a new adventure (did someone say <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/10-dreamy-girls-trip-ideas-across-america" title="girls trip">girls trip</a>?) can give you a break from the everyday stress, allowing you to recharge your batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting there</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be stressful—from making your packing list and checking it twice to dealing with long lines at security and impossibly short layovers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the wrong luggage can make the stress even worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you ready to upgrade your travel game so that you can always hit the road with ample space, amazing organization, and style? At BÈIS, our </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage-bundle" title="luggage sets"><span style="font-weight: 400;">luggage sets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" title="travel accessories"> travel </a><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessories</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> combine form and function.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working from home has its perks—you can go directly from your bed to the computer, and as long as you put on the right top, no one has to know you’re still in pajama bottoms during zoom meetings and video calls!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what you gain in flexibility from remote work you may eventually lose in peace of mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At work, you’d never use the dining table as your desk or leave your breakfast dishes on your desk all day, much less your coffee-stained sticky notes, your hair towel, and the dregs of yesterday’s green juice. When your coworkers aren’t looking, it’s amazing how easy it is to let your deskspace go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all been there—searching under every stray dish and piece of paper for our cell phones, not to mention the meeting notes we absolutely need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a better way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you ready to get organized—and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stay</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> organized—so that your home office setup is actually conducive to working from home? Below are the 11 work from home must haves that will help you work from home </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">without</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the clutter.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#1 Laptop Sleeve</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/fall-collection-2020/products/the-laptop-sleeve-in-black?view=fall" target="_blank" title="black laptop case" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/DSC00942_480x480.jpg?v=1601048262" alt=""></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where are you keeping your laptop these days? If you’re anything like us, you sometimes have to search in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">several </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">places before you finally find it. On the sofa? Under it? On the floor? Under your pillow? Each day is its own unique game of hide-and-seek for one of your most </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">work from home essentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s nothing inherently wrong with designing your own perpetual cat-and-mouse game, there are downsides to leaving your laptop exposed to the elements. We’re talking anything from spilled glasses of water to clumsy pets and household residents alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why you need the BÈIS </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/fall-collection-2020/products/the-laptop-sleeve-in-black?view=fall" target="_blank" title="black laptop sleeve" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laptop case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect your valuable hardware. To keep you organized and safe, it features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two pen slips</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ample padding</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An organizational pocket for extra accessories, such as blue light blocking glasses</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sleeve is so chic you’ll be happy to take it on your occasional visits to the neighborhood coffee shop, too! </span></p>
<h2><strong>#2 Laptop Stand</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/twelve-south-curve-stand-for-macbook/6438793.p?skuId=6438793&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=BM01&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAwf39BRCCARIsALXWETxK1OQF6SrnFh9yDcCKJgrtCKPPxrzw6PaU-Y9bFHZqaoSA6EbLAaQaAjW_EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" title="laptop stand" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/bestbuy_480x480.jpg?v=1606429195" alt="" width="321" height="328"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best work from home setup is one that’s comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you only have a laptop, you may already be feeling some negative physical effects of hunching over your computer for hours on end—after all, laptops aren’t exactly ergonomic. But with a little WFH rearranging, you can create a comfy setup that promotes productivity throughout the day. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re sitting at your desk, the ideal setup is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screen directly in front of your line of vision (not above or below)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keyboard perpendicular to your torso</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shoulders and upper arms relaxed at your sides (not rounding forward)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arms bent at the elbow and fingertips level with keyboard</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your laptop is in a good typing position, the screen is probably too low and can result in eye strain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recommend this </span><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/twelve-south-curve-stand-for-macbook/6438793.p?skuId=6438793&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=1&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=BM01&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAwf39BRCCARIsALXWETxK1OQF6SrnFh9yDcCKJgrtCKPPxrzw6PaU-Y9bFHZqaoSA6EbLAaQaAjW_EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimalist laptop stand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, available at Best Buy. It provides an added boost without raising the keyboard up too high. We also suggest looking into getting a standing desk at home if sitting all day isn’t your cup of tea.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#3 An Ergonomic Chair</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/products/nash-leather-executive-swivel-desk-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/office_chair_240x240.jpg?v=1601048234" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is that sofas, accent chairs, and other cute living room and kitchen furniture are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant for all-day use. If you plan on sitting at your desk for eight hours a day, you need an ergonomic desk chair that supports your lower back and hips so that you feel comfortable all day long—and when you finally get up to move! You can even pair your ergonomic chair with an ergonomic keyboard and ergonomic mouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your work space and your office furniture don’t have to be ugly. Try an upscale </span><a href="https://www.potterybarn.com/products/nash-leather-executive-swivel-desk-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leather office chair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that won’t detract from your home’s ambiance.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#4 File Organizer</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.russellandhazel.com/acrylic-collator-bookend.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/organizer_240x240.jpg?v=1601048234" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s face it: unless you’re a WFH Mary Poppins, there’s only so much you can put inside your desk drawers. And you don’t want to go shuffling through a stack of papers every time you need a really essential document.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution? A </span><a href="https://www.russellandhazel.com/acrylic-collator-bookend.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">desktop file organizer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Russel and Hazel. This minimalist organizer features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 dividers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear acrylic plastic so you can easily view your documents</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleek, polished edges so it’s safe to browse through in frantic moments</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a rainbow color scheme is part of your cute home office vision, you could place a different colored folder in each slot.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#5 Work Tote or Messenger Bag</strong></h2>
<p>Just because you’re working from home doesn’t mean you’re never on the go.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At BÈIS, we know how difficult it is to find a do-it-all <a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-messenger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">black messenger bag</a> that’s safe enough for your laptop, professional enough for work, and fashionable enough to take to dinner afterwards. That’s why we’ve designed two versatile <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/work-totes">work totes</a> for taking your WFH setup on the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on whether you’re a minimalist or maximalist, try out:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/fall-collection-2020/products/the-mini-work-tote-in-black?view=fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Mini Work Tote</strong></a><span> – With two external pockets, a removable pouch, a padded laptop sleeve, and a removable strap, this bag helps you up your organizational game. It’s big enough to stock with everything you need for a day of remote working, but small enough to look good sitting next to you on a barstool if you’re going out after work.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/fall-collection-2020/products/the-mini-work-tote-in-black?view=fall" target="_blank" title="mini work tote" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/DSC01828_480x480.jpg?v=1601048260" alt=""></a><br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/fall-collection-2020/products/the-messenger?view=fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>The Messenger</b></a><span> – If all you need is your laptop, your wallet, a cell phone, and some hand sanitizer, this minimalist bag is for you. With a neoprene laptop pocket and individual compartments for pens and other work day essentials, you’ll never be caught rifling through your bag for your cell phone. The strap is adjustable for cross-body or shoulder use.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/fall-collection-2020/products/the-messenger?view=fall" target="_blank" title="black messenger bag" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/DSC02810_480x480.jpg?v=1601048261" alt=""></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these cute, functional bags, you’ll know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">exactly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which pocket to check for your car keys the next time you’re on the way out the door! </span></p>
<h2><strong>#6 Wireless Charger</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HN7Y2ZM/A/mophie-dual-wireless-charging-pad?fnode=5316cf01d4659c882e55ae3cf9babf181be3a7cc153e899d0e2cda4f7daeed34d862e0ca1c017b73990aabeeb444ae20e440bee843000871a1eee18cf45d0b6161f53d4db7ff9b1c365b4d4cca03acb3bf665a33d3628c7b8a198a92480e6ec6" target="_blank" title="wireless charging port" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/charger_240x240.jpeg?v=1601048295" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does your dedicated workspace look like a plate of digital spaghetti?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find yourself drowning in cables and always on the search for a spare USB port, say goodbye to (some of your) cords with a </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HN7Y2ZM/A/mophie-dual-wireless-charging-pad?fnode=5316cf01d4659c882e55ae3cf9babf181be3a7cc153e899d0e2cda4f7daeed34d862e0ca1c017b73990aabeeb444ae20e440bee843000871a1eee18cf45d0b6161f53d4db7ff9b1c365b4d4cca03acb3bf665a33d3628c7b8a198a92480e6ec6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wireless charging port</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s one less tangle on your desktop. As a bonus, you can stop worrying that your phone’s at 1% every time you need to take a work call. </span></p>
<h2><strong>#7 Vertical Baskets</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/three-tier-basket-wall-storage?category=wall-storage-shelves&amp;color=005" target="_blank" title="wire baskets" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/basket_480x480.jpeg?v=1601048296" alt=""></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a dedicated office space—or even if you do!—you may be running out of storage solutions to store all your home office essentials. But you may be reluctant to put an ugly filing cabinet in your lovely home!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's an easy fix. Make use of vertical space and install a wall organizer directly on the wall behind your external monitor or next to your dedicated workspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love these </span><a href="https://www.anthropologie.com/shop/three-tier-basket-wall-storage?category=wall-storage-shelves&amp;color=005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wire baskets from Anthropologie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are modern office storage with a lightweight look but are sturdy enough to store your extra folders, files, notebooks, and more. Bonus? You can tuck a small succulent or two in the baskets for a fresh splash of green!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">#8 Clipboard</span></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.target.com/p/russell-hazel-acrylic-clip-board/-/A-79731843?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;fndsrc=tgtao&amp;CPNG=PLA_Seasonal%2BShopping&amp;adgroup=SC_Seasonal&amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;location=9061184&amp;ds_rl=1246978&amp;ds_rl=1248099&amp;ds_rl=1247068&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8abcw7L86wIVsR-tBh2wsgXIEAQYDiABEgJvbvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" title="white clipboard" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Screen_Shot_2020-09-22_at_2.01.17_AM_240x240.png?v=1601048233" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clipboards might seem a little old-fashioned. But there are good reasons to add a clipboard to your collection of work from home accessories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Stop searching for a flat surface to bear down on when you’re taking calls in your backyard or from your sofa</li>
<li>Clip important documents at the end of your workday so that they’re handy in the morning</li>
<li>Look super professional in your WFH setup selfies</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We love this stylish </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/russell-hazel-acrylic-clip-board/-/A-79731843?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&amp;AFID=google_pla_df&amp;fndsrc=tgtao&amp;CPNG=PLA_Seasonal%2BShopping&amp;adgroup=SC_Seasonal&amp;LID=700000001170770pgs&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;location=9061184&amp;ds_rl=1246978&amp;ds_rl=1248099&amp;ds_rl=1247068&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8abcw7L86wIVsR-tBh2wsgXIEAQYDiABEgJvbvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clipboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Target.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#9 Pen Cup</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.pantone.com/pantone-pencil-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/pencil_240x240.jpg?v=1601048234" alt="" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you have so many writing utensils, yet never find one when you need one?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It happens to the best of us—our </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">functional </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pens and pencils collect at the back of our desk drawers along with empty mechanical pencil hulls, dried up pens, and an inexplicable number of sharpies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why pen and pencil cups are one of the most underrated home office essentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For best results, try the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go through your drawer and test each pencil and pen. Toss the ones that don’t work, once and for all!</span></li>
<li>
<span>Place your favorite pens and pencils in a stylish </span><a href="https://www.pantone.com/products/pantone-lifestyle/pantone-pencil-cup?utm_source=googlefeed&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr9_a5aX86wIVKD2tBh3pTwf0EAQYAiABEgJTy_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>ceramic pen-holder</span></a><span> from Pantone</span>
</li>
<li>Use rubber bands to tie together markers, highlighters, and other writing utensils that you only use occasionally. Organize these in your drawers.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>#10 Desk Organizing Trays</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.desertcart.us/products/59079938-isaac-jacobs-clear-acrylic-serving-tray-11x17-with-silver-metal-handles-spill-proof-stackable-organizer-food-drinks-server-indoors-outdoors-lucite-storage-11x17-clear-with-silver-handle" target="_blank" title="desk organizer" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/31gXNA246EL_240x240.jpg?v=1601048294" alt=""></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to do once you’ve tied those markers together?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t just toss them back into the drawer, where they’ll be destined for eventual disorganized doom. Instead, start to organize the interior of your desk. (If your desk doesn’t have drawers, all the more reason to purchase a desk organizer to store your office supplies!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than placing objects in or on your desk willy-nilly, we recommend the </span><a href="https://www.desertcart.us/products/59079938-isaac-jacobs-clear-acrylic-serving-tray-11x17-with-silver-metal-handles-spill-proof-stackable-organizer-food-drinks-server-indoors-outdoors-lucite-storage-11x17-clear-with-silver-handle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear acrylic trays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Isaac Jacobs. Buy them in a few different sizes to turn your drawer’s large interior into separate compartments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With silver handles, these home office accessories look great, wherever you put them. The clear plastic is an extra motivation to keep the objects inside organized!</span></p>
<h2><strong>#11 Noise Canceling Headphones</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_black" target="_blank" title="black headphones" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/cq5dam.web.1000.1000_240x240.png?v=1601048296" alt=""></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve organized your designated workspace, it’s much easier to block out the mental chatter that can distract you from your task load and lead you to spend more time at your desk than is necessary (or desirable). Especially, if you are </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/how-to-work-from-home-with-kids-and-stay-organized" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working from home with kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or roommates, you know how distracting the constant background noise can be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you need a way to block out the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">literal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noise, whether it’s your cat’s mewing, your kids attending Zoom school, or your roommate singing in the shower—just some of the reasons why noise canceling headphones are on our list of home office necessities to get you in the ultimate wfh mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bose’s well-regarded </span><a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noise canceling headphones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are now available in custom colors. Get a pair that’s comfy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cool enough to actually leave the house in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California wine country is just about unparalleled when it comes to natural beauty, year-round perfect weather, and plenty of fun activities for a gaggle of ladies looking to cut loose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan the perfect girls getaway with the following tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Napa Valley and Sonoma are popular destinations, but if you and your friends love spa treatments and a small town feel, consider Calistoga. Likewise, Healdsburg is a fantastic destination with plenty of bars and restaurants and great happy hour options.</li>
<li>When in wine country, do as the locals do—hire a professional to drive you to the best vineyards in the area. That way, you don’t have to take turns being the designated driver!</li>
<li>Visit the Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve to take in some fresh air and see some of the oldest trees in the country. </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take in the breathtaking views of the most gorgeous vineyards with a horseback riding tour of Jack London Estate. </span></li>
</ul>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>What to Pack For Your Weekend Trip</strong></h3>

<h2><strong>#7 Sedona, Arizona </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_1054046408_480x480.jpg?v=1601048052" alt=""></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying local? Sedona is also known for the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New age culture</span><span> – Are you and your friends into crystals, Reiki, and energy healing? Or are you interested in seeing a psychic for the first time to see what all the fuss is about? Sedona is chocked-full of new age stores and alternative practitioners.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Spas</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Enjoy some of the country’s most beautiful spas, where you’ll find traditional mud wraps, saunas, and facials alongside alternative therapies.</span>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>What to Pack For Your Weekend Trip</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure you have a camera on-hand to capture the natural beauty of this desert landscape (and to take a few group pictures, of course)!</span></p>
<h2><strong>#8 Charleston, South Carolina</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_1366721726_480x480.jpg?v=1601048053" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charleston is an elegant port city that combines the best of Southern dining with easy accessibility to beaches and luxury shopping. It’s the perfect place for a girls weekend getaway filled with Southern decadence!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be sure to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eat a southern breakfast of shrimp &amp; grits with your cocktail of choice</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out the Tavern at Rainbow Row, the oldest liquor store in the country </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shop from upscale boutiques and vintage stores on King Street</span></li>

</ul>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>What to Pack For Your Weekend Trip</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got to try oysters on the half-shell, chicken-fried steak, and a dozen other Southern specialties. That means you’ll need a pair of elastic waist pants.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#9 Sun Valley, Idaho</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_567158326_480x480.jpg?v=1601048046" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to spend some time </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> getting away from it all? Relatively off the beaten track, Sun Valley, Idaho features some of the only hot springs in the country, along with a world of breathtaking views and natural wonders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sun Valley has attractions for all seasons, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Frenchman’s Bend hot springs  </span><span>– In autumn, there’s nothing like dipping into a pool of naturally heated fresh water at the end of a day hiking and playing outdoors.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Skiing and snowboarding</span><span> – If your friends group boasts a few snow bunnies, you’ll enjoy the pristine slopes during this outdoor adventure!</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mountain lakes</span><span> – If you plan your trip during the balmy Idaho summer, cool off in icy mountain lakes and streams. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re back at home base, you’ll find plenty of delicious food at restaurants, bars, as well as spas in this resort town.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>What to Pack For Your Weekend Trip</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re spending time in Sun Valley, you’re more likely than not to do something active! Bring a muscle balm to give yourself a little extra TLC on top of any spa treatment you book.</span></p>
<h2><strong>#10 Salem &amp; North Shore, Massachusetts</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_609835217_480x480.jpg?v=1601048046" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Salem is known for its history as the home of America’s witch trials, it’s also an oceanfront city on the North Shore of Cape Cod. That means it’s the perfect spot to summon your inner mystic </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> catch some waves, making it one of the best girls trip destinations imaginable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We suggest the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Tour the Salem Witch Museum and learn more about the city’s history. Don’t stop at the gift shop, though—there are countless witch stores throughout the city where modern women sell their homemade witchy wares!</li>
<li>Get a psychic reading or buy your own deck of tarot cards to play with all weekend long. Crow Haven is the oldest witch shop in Salem. We also enjoy HausWitch’s modern approach to magic. </li>
<li>Enjoy the beach during the peak months of July and August. While Dead Horse Beach has an ominous name, that’s all in keeping with the locale’s unique history! You could also check out Winter Island.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond summer adventures, it goes without saying that Salem is the perfect place to spend Halloween.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>What to Pack For Your Weekend Trip</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose Salem for your next girls trip destination, be sure to bring a jacket. Massachusetts starts to get chilly as early as August!</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Best Girls Trips Start with Your Best Girls</strong></h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-dopp-kit-in-sakura-pink" target="_blank" title="light pink dopp skit" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/beis_photo_480x480.png?v=1601048064" style="float: none;" width="480x480" height="480x480"></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re planning for a girls weekend getaway or a more extended besties-only vacation, it’s not about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">where </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re going, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re with. So long as you’re with the most important women in your life, it doesn’t matter if you’re vineyard hopping in California or telling spooky stories in front of your Airbnb’s fireplace in Massachusetts—adventure, good times, and amazing memories will be sure to follow. </span></p>
<h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Travel in Style With BÈIS</strong> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your girlfriends probably won’t judge you if you’re still lugging around the same carry-on you had in college. But wouldn’t you feel better if you gave yourself an added treat with upgraded </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="travel luggage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="travel accessories"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel accessories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, it’s hard to get in the mood for a relaxing long weekend when you’re taping your suitcase shut and troubleshooting bum wheels on the way to the airport!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our #1 travel tip: Get your life organized with our functional, fashionable and affordable luggage so you can relax with your besties—and return home with your souvenirs safely in tow, too. </span></p>
<p>If you're looking for more girls' weekend ideas consider cities such as Tulum, San Diego, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, or San Francisco.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Fly With Kids</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-packing-cubes-in-beige?_pos=2&amp;_sid=479508e60&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="packing cubes in luggage" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="https://beistravel.com/products/the-cosmetic-pouch-set-in-natural" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/packing_with_family_large.png?v=1598877900" style="float: none;"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flying with children for the first time is stressful.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try not to let this fear keep you and your family from living your lives. With these useful airline tips (like making sure your<a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags"> travel bags</a> are in tip top organization), you can get rid of the extra travel day stress on you and your little ones. </span><span data-slate-leaf="true">Knowing </span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">how to </span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">travel</span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic"> with kids</span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true"> is one thing, but taking them on a </span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">long </span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">flight</span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-slate-fragment="JTVCJTdCJTIyY2hpbGRyZW4lMjIlM0ElNUIlN0IlMjJ0ZXh0JTIyJTNBJTIyS25vd2luZyUyMGhvdyUyMHRvJTIwdHJhdmVsJTIwd2l0aCUyMGtpZHMlMjBpcyUyMG9uZSUyMHRoaW5nJTJDJTIwYnV0JTIwdGFraW5nJTIwdGhlbSUyMG9uJTIwYSUyMGxvbmclMjBmbGlnaHQlMjBtaWdodCUyMHNlZW0lMjBkYXVudGluZy4lMjIlN0QlNUQlMkMlMjJ0eXBlJTIyJTNBJTIycGFyYWdyYXBoJTIyJTdEJTVE"> might seem daunting.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Do Babies Need Their Own Seat on a Plane?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For domestic travel, kids under the age of two are considered “lap infants,” which is exactly what it sounds like—you share a seat. Airlines only allow one lap infant per adult, so if you’re flying solo and have more than one child under two with you, you’ll need to buy a ticket for one of them.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Does My 2-Year-Old Need a Car Seat on a Plane?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the decision of whether or not to fly with your child in a car seat is totally up to you, it’s the safest way to travel and you should strongly consider it, whether your child is two or younger.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and American Academy of Pediatrics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommend—it has less to do with age and more to do with weight:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Less than 20 pounds </span><span>– Use a rear-facing infant car seat</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Between 20 and 40 pounds</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Use a forward-facing car seat or Child Aviation Restraint System (CARES), which is suitable for kids age one and up between 22-44 pounds</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Over 40 pounds </span><span>– Use the airplane seatbelt</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are some other reasons why bringing a car seat is a good idea:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the perfect on-the-go kid’s chair while waiting at the airport.</span></li>
<li>You can ask the gate agents if there are empty seats on the flight—if there are, they can move you so your child (and their car seat) get their own space on the plane for free.</li>
<li>Car seats and compact folding strollers can be brought on the plane (in addition to your carry-on and personal item) or checked at the gate for free, so you don’t have to hang on to it if you decide you won’t be needing it until you land.</li>
<li>If you’re worried you’ll have too much to carry, you can easily arrange for someone to help you through the airport.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Car seats need to be FAA-approved (they’ll have a sticker that says “This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft”) and should be 16 inches wide or less to make sure they fit nicely in most airplane seats.</span></p>
<h3><strong>When Is the Best Time of Day to Travel With a Toddler?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people say that traveling with toddlers should be done during the day so you don’t have to worry about keeping people up, while others would rather run that risk if it means their child may sleep through the flight. But one tip a lot of parents have had success with is scheduling flights around nap times. </span><span data-slate-leaf="true">Don't worry! This is just one of plenty of <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/6-tips-for-traveling-with-toddlers">tips for </a></span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/6-tips-for-traveling-with-toddlers"><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">traveling</span></span></a><span data-slate-leaf="true"><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/6-tips-for-traveling-with-toddlers"> with toddlers</a> so that you can enjoy your </span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">family</span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic"> </span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">travel</span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-slate-fragment="JTVCJTdCJTIyY2hpbGRyZW4lMjIlM0ElNUIlN0IlMjJ0ZXh0JTIyJTNBJTIyRG9uJ3QlMjB3b3JyeSElMjBUaGlzJTIwaXMlMjBqdXN0JTIwb25lJTIwb2YlMjBwbGVudHklMjBvZiUyMHRpcHMlMjBmb3IlMjB0cmF2ZWxpbmclMjB3aXRoJTIwdG9kZGxlcnMlMjBzbyUyMHRoYXQlMjB5b3UlMjBjYW4lMjBlbmpveSUyMHlvdXIlMjBmYW1pbHklMjB0cmF2ZWwuJTIyJTdEJTVEJTJDJTIydHlwZSUyMiUzQSUyMnBhcmFncmFwaCUyMiU3RCU1RA==">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By booking your flight so that nap time happens while you’re in the air, you’ll have the best chance of your child sleeping on the plane. You still can’t bank on your child sleeping the whole flight though.</span></p>
<h3><strong>How Can I Keep My Child from Getting Sick on the Plane?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest concerns for parents traveling with kids is the threat of them getting sick. Airports and airplanes are full of germs, but there are plenty of ways to protect your young child and you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, airports and airplanes have upped their cleaning techniques, require face masks (except for kids under the age of two), and even installed high-grade HEPA air filters on board. But to be extra safe, here are some things you should do:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Make a pre-travel doctor’s visit </span><span>– Depending on where and when you’re traveling, your young child may need to have their routine vaccinations early. Visit the doctor’s office and plan this out ahead of time to avoid fevers, rashes, and other negative reactions during your family</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span>vacation—the CDC</span><span> suggests making this appointment at least one month in advance.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pick a window seat </span><span>– With items falling from overhead bins and service carts passing through the aisle, window seats have always been the safest option for small kids, but now there’s another reason: sitting in a window seat makes you less likely to get sick, according to a study by Emory University</span><span>.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Disinfect your space </span><span>– Fill a small </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel organizer bag</span></a><span> with anti-bacterial wipes and mini disinfectant spray to clean seats, seatbelts, arm rests, tray tables, and any other high-touch surfaces you can think of—don’t forget to pack hand sanitizer you can use when you’re done.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BYOCP </span><span>– Bring Your Own Changing Pad. It’s safe to assume that every changing table you’ll come across on travel day is far from clean. That’s why putting your own portable surface in your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/pages/baby-collection" style="font-weight: bold;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby travel bag</span></a><span> is an easy way to limit germs and irritants on your baby’s soft, sensitive skin.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Should I Bring on a Plane for My Toddler?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not everyone wants to bring a car seat, CARES harness, and stroller on board, you shouldn’t step on the plane without these five things.</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Multi-Tasking Diaper Bag</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-diaper-bag-in-beige" target="_blank" title="beige diaper bag" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Screen_Shot_2020-08-23_at_11.10.42_PM_large.png?v=1598884356" alt=""></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re allowed to have a carry-on bag, personal item, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper bag, so making sure it’s a versatile one, like the BÈIS </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-diaper-bag-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaper Bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is important. In your diaper bag, make sure you are equipped with everything you need for your long trip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of the multi-purpose aspects to look for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Travel-friendly </span><span>– Built-in trolley sleeve, loops that attach to our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">stroller bags</span><span>, and a laptop sleeve in case you don’t want to lug around separate bags.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Adjustable straps </span><span>– 4 sets of interchangeable straps in different sizes and styles.</span><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Easy-access organization </span><span>– With an odor-proof bag for dirty diapers, reusable changing pad, pockets for new diapers and wet wipes, two bottle holders, pacifier pouch, and adorable teething ring keychain, this bag’s got your back. You’ll remember where you put all your baby needs.</span><b> </b>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. On-the-Go Nap-Worthy Comfort</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some undeniable truths in life, like: planes get cold, kids are messy, and sleep is sacred. Make sure you have a change of clothes for both of you that can also double as an extra layer if it gets chilly. A baby blanket and travel toddler bed can go a long way too, and don’t forget a pillow of your own to take advantage of that momentary bliss.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Snacks, Bottles, and More Snacks</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, food, water, and milk or formula are necessities, but snacks are one of the best ways to keep a child busy and happy. Standard TSA liquid rules don’t apply to any baby food, so go crazy… There’s no better place for a food coma than at cruising altitudes.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. DIY First Aid Kit</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting together a DIY emergency kit when traveling with young kids is a little different than your typical first aid kit—here’s what you’ll want to pack:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different size bandages</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antibiotic ointment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual rubbing alcohol prep pads</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain meds, fever reducers, and gas relievers (for babies and adults)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children’s ear pain drops (ask your pediatrician first)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily prescriptions, vitamins, and supplements</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. In-Flight Baby-Friendly Entertainment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think no-mess, hands-on airplane activities like drawing, playing with favorite toys (and teething toys), reading a book together, or watching a kids’ TV show. Sure, pediatricians don’t recommend screen time for babies, but kiddie headphones exist for a reason—you both deserve this.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Get There with BÈIS Baby</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÈIS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can find your go-to </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that you need to make traveling with young kids easier, all while nailing the timeless jet-setter look.

Even if they don’t remember the experience when they get older, you’ll remember the way your child’s sweet, happy face looked forever—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even if you’re just watching them at the waffle maker</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communicating with your kids during the trip-planning process brings you closer together and sets you up for a positive (tantrum-free) vacation.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen to Your Little One’s Suggestions</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a study by HomeAway and FamilyFun Magazine</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, kids were excited about the idea of staying in treehouses, private islands, and castles. That may seem hard to pull off, but there are some crazy vacation rentals on the market today, and at the very least, you can easily find a children’s museum with a treehouse, plan a picnic on a lake island, or visit a fancy historic home.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bring Their Friends (and Yours) Along</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your little ones are old enough to walk, talk, and play on their own, they’ll want to be around kids their own age. You may want to invite other relatives or family friends on vacation with you, especially if you have an only child—bringing other adults you trust is a win-win because you can trade off parenting duties in exchange for kid-free date nights.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think About the Traveling Process</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for the best family vacations on a budget, your mode of transportation is a major factor. The decision to drive or fly really depends on where you’re going and for how long, but there are some other things to consider:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Make health a priority</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Putting the physical or mental health of anyone in your family at risk is never worth it (health is wealth!)—and yes, this includes your own pre-flight and on-the-road anxiety. Your child may have sensitive ears, which makes flying an issue, or you might be worried about driving because of motion sickness and rest-stop cleanliness. Listen to your gut. Then make a Readiness Checklist. Include all the necessities for travel that you can think of.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>“Lap infants” fly free</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Children under the age of 2 don’t need their own plane ticket if you’re comfortable holding them throughout the flight. Plus, you get to bring a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-diaper-bag-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diaper bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, car seat, and collapsible stroller for free and can use a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/the-baby-collection/products/the-bottle-cooler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bottle cooler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a carry-on since TSA regulations don’t apply to your baby’s milk, formula, or food.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>You may still need to buy a kids’ ticket </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– There’s a strict ratio of 1 lap infant per 1 adult, so you may end up buying plane tickets for your kids—and if your kids are two or older, you’ll have no choice but to. Don’t let the “kids’ ticket” term fool you. Some airlines, like Southwest, offer reduced fares for children, but most will make you pay the same adult ticket price.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How Can I Travel Cheap with Kids?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning the best family vacations on a budget starts by picking a tentative destination and then following these steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Price out </span><a href="http://beistravel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>travel essentials</span></a><span>, flights, car rentals, and gas (using an </span><a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/trip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>online tool</span></a><span> to get an estimate based on your exact car and driving distance).</span>
</li>
<li>Check if this is the type of trip that offers all-inclusive vacation packages. If so, what do you get, and for what price?</li>
<li>If you aren’t taking the all-inclusive route, look into places to stay and make a rough plan of how you’re going to tackle mealtimes with kids—if you need kitchen access, opt for a vacation rental rather than a resort or hotel.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Exactly Is an All-Inclusive Vacation?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All-inclusive vacations” are sort of a catch-all term for all-inclusive resorts and all-inclusive vacation packages. For resorts, you make one big payment that covers accommodation, food and drinks (either a set amount or all-you-can-eat), and some on-property activities and amenities, from scuba diving lessons to child care—however, it’s up to you to figure out how to get there. Vacation packages are usually a combination of all-inclusive resorts and airfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all things in life, you should always read the fine print before making a commitment. All-inclusive vacation packages may relieve some of your planning stress, but they definitely aren’t cost-effective for everyone.</span></p>
<h4><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I Book an All-Inclusive Vacation?</span></i></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these statements sound like you and your family, you’ll save money and have fun with an all-inclusive vacation package:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to stay busy and active</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You stay on resort property for most of your vacation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re comfortable befriending strangers and doing group activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have growing kids that eat a lot and have tons of energy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to unwind with a glass of wine</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could use the help of child care facilities</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What Are the Top 10 Family Vacation Spots?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For families that are looking for flexible, personalized travel plans, here are 10 places where you can have the best family vacations on a budget from the west coast to the east coast.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#1 Phoenix, Arizona</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_1176204118_2ab088a4-1cdb-44b8-92d3-7baffb58929b_large.jpg?v=1598873756" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your kids are fascinated by the natural wonders of the world, visiting Grand Canyon National Park is a must. Whether you make it a road trip or get a rental car at the Phoenix airport (3.5 hours away), it’s worth it to spend some time in the city first. To really make your journey memorable, pack all the road trip essentials like snacks and games. This will not only help you save on your cheap family vacation, but it will also help to keep the kids entertained! You can visit museums in art, music, and Native American culture. Also, check out the science centers, famous zoo and aquarium, and the gardens and parks scattered throughout the area.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#2 Moab, Utah</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_126126524_29ddb22f-c60f-44fe-b542-842ca0e28e4b_large.jpg?v=1598873767" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for another fantastic </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/5-amazing-road-trip-ideas-across-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">road trip idea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? If so, Utah is an excellent choice. For all the dinosaur enthusiasts, fossil fiends, and sun lovers, Moab, Utah is the place to be—these are some of the things you can check out while you’re there:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Moab Giants </span><span>– An outdoor paleo-amusement park and playground featuring life-size dinosaur replicas, walking trails, and mini excavation sites.</span><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Arches National Park</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">– Known for incredible views and giant all-natural sandboxes that kids love to play in.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Teepee-style glamping</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> –</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">There are tons of accommodations that mix camping fun (like s’mores by the fire) with hotel amenities (like king-sized beds) that’ll keep you comfortable and engaged with one another.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>#3 Port Angeles, Washington</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_1044481825_82f87b3e-5222-4c9a-98a6-12de846ffc15_large.jpg?v=1598873760" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olympic National Park is one of the most underrated vacation spots. With three ecosystems to explore (mountains, rainforests, and coastal tide pools), you can take a shaded stroller-friendly hike, go for a warm mineral-infused dip in the Sol Duc Hot Springs, or stop for a picnic on the sand.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#4 Myrtle Beach, South Carolina </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_280876238_large.jpg?v=1598877232" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t know how to keep kids busy? Take them to the beach and let them have some fun in the sun! With lifeguard-patrolled beaches, outlet malls, amusement parks, aquariums, and tons of places to stay right on the water, this laid-back destination is a manageable drive for East Coasters, and has its own international airport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To save some money, book a hotel away from the water—there are tons of fun resorts with lazy rivers, waterpark-style pools, and cute cabanas that you can easily snag a deal on without sacrificing kid-friendly fun.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#5 Ocean City, Maryland</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_129878591_1_large.jpg?v=1598873762" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a livelier beach and boardwalk experience, Ocean City fits the bill. Your family will get to have the classic summer vacation with a huge beach, mini-golf (and regular golf) courses, quaint ice cream shops, and outdoor events you can walk between.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#6 Catskill Mountains, New York</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_305295830_large.jpg?v=1598873772" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Catskill region is far from the star-studded party spot it was in the ‘70s and has since become a quiet, peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. If you’re looking for a change of pace, the Catskills are a great place to experience farm life. You’ll get to eat someone else’s delicious, all-natural, home-cooked meals for a change, and your kids will have the time of their lives learning about all the animals.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#7 Lake Champlain, Vermont</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/Lake_Champlain_Vermont_large.png?v=1598873786" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standout all-inclusive resort on this list is The Tyler Place Family Resort in Vermont. There are programs for kids of all ages (even newborns), candlelit adult-only cocktails and dining, and tons of attentive parents’ helpers—every caregiver only watches 1-2 kids at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With arts and crafts, water sports on the lake, indoor pools, bikes with baby seats, and teepees and treehouses, you’ll have a fun, safe, cost-effective way to have a family trip that really feels like a vacation.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#8 Williamsburg, Virginia</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_502439266_1f755bab-e28d-4332-995f-61b1ac80f1a4_large.jpg?v=1598873771" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all the little history buffs and amusement park lovers out there, Williamsburg offers a unique experience that’s exciting and educational, and has tons of packages (like the Kids Play Free Package) that combines your choice of hotel with free admission to a range of parks and museums.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#9 Captiva and Sanibel Islands, Florida</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_9928675_80c0035c-20d2-4fd7-abc8-20ad475086dc_large.jpg?v=1598873764" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Captiva Island, and its sister island Sanibel, seem like a higher-end option, there are great resort deals especially in the summer. This is the perfect destination for families that aren’t looking for lots of structure and just want to take a breath. Between the shorefront beach villas, swim lessons, and crafts center, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">breathtaking </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sunsets, you’ll never want to leave.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#10 Riviera Maya, Mexico</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_647628562_large.jpg?v=1598873764" alt=""></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a seemingly endless list of all-inclusive vacation packages in Mexico, and this laid-back tourist-favorite is no different. The best rates for family packages are in the fall, which works out well because the temperature is a lot more enjoyable once summer has passed. Many resorts include a kids club or special toddler and baby programs and offer on-call babysitting for an extra fee, giving you some time to enjoy the beautiful beach yourself.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Travel Gear for the Whole Gang</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter where you’re headed, BÈIS has all the </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">luggage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags">travel bags</a>, and </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">travel accessories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you’ll need to feel prepared and look stylish for the family fun. BÈIS knows that as a parent, you wear many hats—caretaker, chef, problem-solver and travel agent.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all got baggage, but it’s not a bad thing when yours is BÈIS.</span></i></p>

    <title>Travel Baggage: Experiences of a Black Woman Traveling</title>

      <![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested in learning more about what it's like to travel as a black woman to a foreign place? Read on for personal experiences and stories.</span><p><a class="read-more" href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/travel-baggage-experiences-of-a-black-woman-traveling">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was a little girl, my parents used to take me on nighttime drives to put me to sleep. Probably because I wouldn’t stop talking, but I like to think it’s because they knew I was born to travel. As I’ve grown older, I still find that I’m my most peaceful when I’m on a trip to someplace new. I’ve felt exploring new destinations to be a rite of passage, as do most Millennials and Generation Z folks. However, when I travel as a Black Woman -- whether in the United States or abroad -- I’m met with experiences that you can only know if you’re in </span><b>this skin.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling is -- for lack of better words -- dope! Exploring new destinations can be beautiful, exciting, enriching, and surreal. It can also be scary, nerve-racking, and disorienting. For a Black woman, in congruence with those mentioned above, it’s also invasive, political, and dangerous - especially when solo traveling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Group travel is my favorite mode of exploration -- who doesn’t love exploring the world with friends?! However, having been in groups with mixed demographics, I’ve seen how my skin tone and accent change how I am treated.  For instance, we might all arrive at the same airport with the same destination in mind, however, when it’s time to show our passports, my white friends will be lackadaisically scanned and sent through while mine will be scrutinized.  I can recall an occurrence when I arrived in Mexico and was standing in the passport check line for International security. I noticed a white family that was on both my initial and connecting flights.  They went up to the counter and were waved through with cursory glances over their documents. On the other hand, I was glared at, looked up and down, and then asked the question...</span></p>
<h2><strong>FIRST IMPRESSIONS?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Soooo...where are you from?” The answer is never, “Texas” or “Los Angeles,” since what they’re really asking about is my African descent. There’s always a look of disappointment on their faces when I tell them I’m simply a Black American from Texas or live in Los Angeles. In these situations, I often wonder: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I lie and say I’m from Nigeria? I have a lot of Nigerian friends, maybe they’ll believe me. Should I tell them that it’s possible that I’m from Africa, but my ancestors were slaves, so I truly don’t know exactly where I’m from? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always decide to give them an uncomfortable little giggle and say, “Just Texas, yeehaw!” (People that aren’t from Texas love the nod towards cowboy culture -- I’ve never actually seen a cowboy, and I promise I don’t ride a horse to the grocery store.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s the hair situation.  For me, doing my hair every morning is like creating a masterpiece: artistic, time-consuming, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be tampered with. At the airport, I’ve had to give up that mantra. For the texture and the artistry of the artwork upon my dome </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">must </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mean that I’m hiding some kind of contraband.  </span><b>Spoiler alert:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’m not, and now you just messed up my really cute ‘do...thanks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there are the paparazzi -- or at least that’s how I see them.  I don’t think that the rich and famous are particularly fond of being photographed without their consent, but they accept it as the price of fame.  I, however, am neither famous nor being paid, so these particular paparazzi are doubly unwanted. The main people I am referring to are those who have likely never seen a Black person in real life. They’d come up to my friends and me asking for pictures with us, and at first, it didn’t phase me.  I was like, “Ooooo; you think my outfit is fresh today.  Please photograph away, be my guest.” As my awareness of their ask grew, I started to feel uncomfortable. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What were these people going to do with my picture, and why did I have no agency in it? Would it be rude to say no though my body is my own and belongs to me, even in a picture? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the questions that I still have.  I never want to come off culturally insensitive, but today, I’m not a cultural attraction. I’m just a person. </span></p>
<h3><strong>REWRITING THE NARRATIVE</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="mayaesthetic.com" target="_blank" title="black woman with flowers" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/sanfrancisco_1_large.jpg?v=1596776073" style="float: none;"></a></p>
<p><b><i>“Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Mark Twain</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When black women travel, it can be an incredibly nuanced experience. There’s some bad, but so much beauty.  One of the most special opportunities is the chance to create peace and promote intelligence through understanding.  As a black traveler, I am afforded the opportunity -- should I decide I have the mental capacity -- to reverse negative perceptions of the Black Community, in the travel industry often perpetuated by the media.  Those that have never met a Black American tend to have an extremely monolithic view of us.  While the media may show us as the trio of rappers, athletes, and “thugs.” We have the power to show the world that we are doctors, lawyers, academics, professionals, and so much more than cinema’s often myopic view of us.  I’m able to have the interactions that bridge gaps between cultures of the world and make us understand that even though our outsides are different, we’re more alike on the inside than we may know.</span></p>
<h3><strong>LOOK, BUT DON’T TOUCH!</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>“Don’t touch my hair.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Solange Knowles, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t Touch My Hair</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So picture this: I’m sitting on a bench outside of my hotel and out of nowhere, a hand is launched towards my head. In confusion, I stand still.  “Wow your hair is so.... Can I touch it?” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I would have said no, but you’ve already got your fingers intertwined with my curls, so now I feel slightly powerless and very...violated?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling as a black woman means that people will likely ask to touch your hair -- </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you’ve practiced your Matrix lean.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It means men may grab your arm in crowded areas or offer you money on public transit.  It means they may follow you on the street.  It means that your personal space will be invaded and because of the color of your skin, people will assume they have unlimited access to your personal being. They shouldn’t, and they don’t.  Black women are often hypersexualized and fetishized in the media; these depictions lead to degrading assumptions and actions by those who may not interact with Black women often or at all.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To any Black woman that may read this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as we pray for the world to change and for our bodies to be respected on every continent, be careful and aware as you travel.</span></p>
<h3><strong>RE-CONNECTING WITH HISTORY</strong></h3>
<p><b><i>“Travel is an inherently political act, even as it is an intensely personal journey.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Mary-Alice Daniel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling While Black Can Be Downright Bizarre</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dear grandmothers could have only dreamed of going to the places I’ve been to! As much as domestic and international travel feels to be a rite of passage for me, the ability to do so is powerfully political. When my grandmothers and their mothers were growing up -- around the time of the Civil Rights Era -- there was scarcely enough disposable income in the African American population for leisurely activities, let alone lavish travel. Even more than that, traveling at that time was life-threatening for the Black community, which is why Victor H. Green published </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Negro Traveler’s Green Book.  </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This book gave Black travelers a list of safe places to stay and stop whilst traversing the United States.  In one edition, Green optimistically wrote, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published.  That is when we, as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although this book no longer boasts new editions, we haven’t yet made it to the America that Green describes. That is why I feel empowered when I travel. I feel that the generations that came before me, those who fought for me to have the right and the means to immerse myself in new cultures, the ancestors who walked the paths that I now trot, are with me wherever I go. I go there for them and for my descendants to come.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m eternally thankful for sites like</span></i><a href="https://www.blackgirlstraveltoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Girls Travel Too</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span></i><a href="https://travelnoire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel Noire</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> -- our modern day Green Books -- for creating communities where we can see ourselves traveling the United States and abroad. They share their travel stories and help us</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">envision ourselves as a part of the traveling communities and alleviate some of the anxiety we might feel walking into a space where we’re unsure whether or not they accept Black people.</span></i></p>
<h3><strong> CLAIMING MY WORLD</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="mayaesthetic.com" target="_blank" title="black woman at disney" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/disneyland_large.JPG?v=1596776071" style="float: none;"></a></p>
<p><b><i>“This world can be our place, too.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Farai Chideya, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling While Black</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can easily recall the time that I felt the most freedom in my </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life. It was at the top of a hike in Cape Town, South Africa. My friends and I found a secluded lake, on a cloudy day, and decided our exploration wouldn’t be complete without a swim. No cell phone service. No other people around. No </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">actual</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bathing suit. Just me, the water, nature, and great company.</span></p>
<p><b><i>“Travel to Africa is among the most healing of all. You go there and get part of your soul back.”</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~ Elaine Lee</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel is healing. Exploration is liberating. Freedom is exhilarating. I find myself at peace when I’m traveling, expanding my horizons, and learning more about myself and the limits of my imagination. Being in </span><b>this skin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the United States and abroad, can make you feel like you don’t belong. It can make you feel like nature, exploration, travel, luxury and excitement are for lighter people with lighter worries. That’s simply untrue. I said that Black travel is political, and I meant it. Every time we leave our homes, fly to another state or country or simply go to the grocery store, we are claiming the world as our own. We have just as much a right to it as anyone else on the planet.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To my Black family, friends, and community: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may travel domestically and internationally. We may explore virtually or physically. We may be free at home or abroad. The important thing is, as we travel and invoke inevitable change in this world, we must remember to </span><b>never stop exploring because the world is ours too</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going on an epic road trip is an adventure everyone should try at least once in their lifetime. Without the stress of airports or the structure of flight schedules, you finally get to have a travel experience where the journey matters just as much as the destination—</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and is just as enjoyable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a flexible, fun, emotionally-fulfilling vacation, it’s time to take a road trip. Exploring America by car is easier and cheaper than most travel plans. All you have to do is fill up your tank, pack all your <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/14-road-trip-essentials-every-traveler-needs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">road trip essentials</a>, and hit the open road. Plus, it gets you out in nature and opens up your mind to other ways of life right outside your backdoor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-packing-cubes-in-beige?_pos=2&amp;_sid=479508e60&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="packing cubes" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/DSC00851_grande.png?v=1595604818" style="float: none;"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what are you waiting for? Keep reading to discover some of the best road trip ideas.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Is the Best Road Trip in the USA?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best routes and road trip ideas depend on whether you’re looking for a shorter, scenic vacation or a full-blown cross-country experience. If you’re looking for travel plans that only require a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-weekender-in-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekender</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a few days on the road, here are three gorgeous road trips to consider.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#1 Pacific Coast Highway</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/pch_grande.jpg?v=1595604829" style="float: none;"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live out your silver screen road trip dreams in a top-down convertible. With the sun on your skin and wind in your hair, you can drive along the famous PCH. This scenic drive could take you from California to Oregon, but if you’re looking for a quick summer getaway, find your way to quiet California beaches like Santa Barbara, in the south, and Big Sur, up north.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#2 Overseas Highway</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_708960514_grande.jpg?v=1595604965" style="float: none;"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bucket-list worthy Florida drive extends from Miami to Key West and can easily be done in one day, but it’s worth it to explore the area on island time. If you want to live like a local, go to the Middle and Lower Keys—make sure to get a slice of authentic Key Lime Pie and a Cuban-inspired cocktail. The Overseas Highway is a scenic route that is perfect for exploring Florida’s coast during your Florida road trip. </span></p>
<h3><strong>#3 Interstate 5</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_541265497_grande.jpg?v=1595604939" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The I-5 connects southern California and Montana, but most people consider the most beautiful part of the drive to be the stretch between Utah and Nevada. With some of the most picturesque deserts in the US, you can visit Red Rock Canyon in Nevada, Antelope Canyon in Arizona, Zion National Park in Utah—and cool off at Lake Powell.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is the Best Route to Drive Cross Country?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to say what the best road trip in America would be, but the most famous is Route 66, and the longest is Route 20.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#4 Route 66</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/route_66_grande.jpg?v=1595604891" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’ve heard of historic Route 66 because of the iconic rhythm and blues song or because you’re a history buff, America’s first all-weather highway connecting Chicago and Los Angeles is popular for a reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Route 66 offers a chance to explore “flyover states,” the geographic center of the country that most coastal Americans only ever see from cruising altitudes. The road isn’t driveable from beginning to end like it used to be back in the day, but almost all of the original drive is still intact—and it’s still the quintessential USA road trip that thousands of international tourists<sub>1 </sub></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do every year.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#5 Route 20</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/shutterstock_138403856_grande.jpg?v=1595604925" alt=""></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Route 20 is the longest road in America, passing through 12 states and making it the perfect choice for a cross-country road trip. Stretching from the Oregon Coast to the heart of Boston, this journey is one you’ll never forget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking for a crazy-long road trip, here’s an idea:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the classic PCH route (Highway 1) from California to Oregon</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get to Newport, Oregon, start your journey on Route 20</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drive until your heart’s content!</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How Long Does it Take to Road Trip Around America?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time to pack your overnight bags because Route 66 is 2,448 miles long and Route 20 is a whopping 3,365 miles, so it’s safe to say a cross-country road trip won’t be a short vacation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could drive Route 66 in around four days each way, and Route 20 in around six days each way, but it’s worth it to block out a good two or three weeks for road trips like these—that way you can drive safely and have enough energy to explore all the states you’ll pass through.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How to Plan a Cross Country Road Trip?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have specific cities, states, historic sites, and landmarks you want to visit, planning a road trip of your own might be an easier way to hit everything on your list. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create your own itinerary, pack your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overnight bags</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and make sure to do your research so you can get the most out of your long car ride. </span></p>

<h3><strong>How Much Does an American Road Trip Cost?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good gauge on how much a road trip will cost depends on a few factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total distance of your total trip—not just your destinations, but every stop along the way</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your car’s mileage, and whether it runs on gas or electricity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re camping (keep in mind that not all campsites are free) or staying in hotels</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By planning out your accommodation ahead of time, you’ll be able to find the best deals on where to stay. If your car isn’t a plug-in or hybrid, you can use an </span><a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/trip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to calculate how much gas will cost you based on your car’s year, make, and model, and your road trip route.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Pack Up and Hit the Road</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of road trips is hidden in the word: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spontaneity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So don’t dwell too much on the planning before hitting the open road. With stylish <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">luggage</a> and multi-purpose <a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel accessories</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">BÈIS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, everything has its place, keeping you organized on your next adventure… Whenever that adventure happens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you're doing a weekend road trip, cross country road trip across America, or exploring the west coast or the east coast, don’t forget to stay present in the moment—these experiences </span><span data-slate-leaf="true">and </span><span data-slate-leaf="true"><span class="getHighlights__Term-sc-1s71y2o-0 bOHVYF highlight--related-topic">breathtaking views</span></span><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-slate-fragment="JTVCJTdCJTIyY2hpbGRyZW4lMjIlM0ElNUIlN0IlMjJ0ZXh0JTIyJTNBJTIyYW5kJTIwYnJlYXRodGFraW5nJTIwdmlld3MlMjB3aWxsJTIwYmUlMjBvbmVzJTIweW91JTIwZG9uJ3QlMjB3YW50JTIwdG8lMjBmb3JnZXQuJTIyJTdEJTVEJTJDJTIydHlwZSUyMiUzQSUyMnBhcmFncmFwaCUyMiU3RCU1RA=="> will be ones you don't want to forget.</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This content was updated for accuracy and relevance on February, 11th 2021.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fun, carefree energy of a road trip can change like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">... (you’ll need to imagine the finger snap). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing kills a vibe like having a dead car battery with no jumper cables or getting a flat tire with no spare or entering a hangry state in the middle of nowhere. We’ve all been there. Especially the hangry state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deciding what things to bring on a road trip, everyone's process is different. Some are okay with being completely unprepared, others like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to pull out their </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/luggage-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hardside luggage sets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pack for a zombie apocalypse. Because, you know, just in case.</span></p>

We want you to spend less time on your packing and more time on planning and organizing all your </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/5-amazing-road-trip-ideas-across-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">road trip ideas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This guide will outline the essentials to pack for any trip and the 5 types of long road trip essentials you should always have with you. That way, you’ll be prepared for a day trip in the woods, a weekend getaway in the desert, or an epic, 3-week, cross-country road trip. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Are the Best Travel Essentials?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-wristlet-set-in-natural" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/DSC00839_1_grande.jpg?v=1595605042" alt=""></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traveling is a wonderful way to gain a new perspective on the world. Not only does it broaden your horizons, but it also allows you to learn about and <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/the-importance-of-understanding-different-cultures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">understand different cultures</a>. Whether traveling by plane, train, or automobile, you should never leave for a trip without your travel essentials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Place these somewhere safe for your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">long drive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like in zippered compartments of a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-weekender-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekender</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-backpack-in-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">black backpack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Everyday essentials </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Keep your wallet, sunglasses, phone charger, portable battery pack, and headphones in a convenient place like an outer zippered pocket of a backpack. This is mostly for convenience. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential convenience.</span></i>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Shay-inspired “staying alive bag”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Fill a compact pouch with daily vitamins, supplements, medications, and your favorite tea bags. Just because you’re on a long road trip, doesn’t mean you’re slipping on that well-being train.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Germ and stain protection </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Add disinfecting wet wipes, hand sanitizer, and a face mask, so you can keep germs at bay. Add an on-the-go stain remover stick if you’re prone to red wine, green juice, and melted chocolate spills. You don’t want stains to set and who knows when you’ll do laundry next! Keep clean and germ-free while road tripping by bringing lots of hand sanitizer, wet wipes, and stain remover sticks for the whole car to use.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Toiletries </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Put your deodorant, toothbrush and toothpaste, skincare products, and any other bottles, tubes, jars, and sprays in a spill-proof toiletry bag such as a </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/beis-dopp-kit-black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dopp kit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are going on a long road trip by car, it might also be wise to throw in a roll of toilet paper just in case.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<b>Makeup and brushes </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">With a multi-compartment, spill-proof, </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/beis-cosmetic-case-beige" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosmetic bag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can easily access your makeup and brushes on-the-go, no matter where you are.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's it, right? Ready to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit the open road</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not quite.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What to Pack for a <i>Road Trip</i>?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Road trip travel essentials build off of the 5 regular travel necessities and form a separate road trip checklist of 5 additional must-haves, made specifically for going out on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">open road</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 7 out of 10 Americans<sup>1 </sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say they plan on taking a road trip in the near future—if you’re one of them, here are 5 must haves for a long successful road trip.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#1 Car Safety Equipment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hitting the road means you have to prepare for the worst when it comes to your car—you probably </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">get pulled over or have some big car problem, but just in case, you’ll want to be prepared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you have the following with you at all times:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">License and registration (obviously)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A copy of your auto insurance policy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your car’s user manual</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spare tire</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadside emergency kit</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, it will help if you know a thing or two about how to use that spare tire and emergency kit. Before you head out on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that epic road trip</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, check in with your local mechanic, car shop, knowledgeable friend, or trusty Google, and get a quick refresher on automobile 101.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#2 In-Car Comfort</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re camping or staying in a hotel, being comfortable on the journey there is crucial—both as a driver and a passenger. Imagine spending 12 hours on the road because there’s a magical once-in-a-thousand-years meteor shower over the Grand Canyon. For that, and for all the other times spent in the car, some in-car comfort will smooth any bumpy road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what you should pack for in-car comfort and convenience:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throw blanket</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel pillow</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Road trip snacks</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Car charger</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paper towels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small bags for garbage</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reusable shopping bags</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>#3 Extra Toiletries</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are, you’ll need to pack extra personal care items for yourself and others. It’s impossible to be prepared for everything, but since you’ll most likely be spending more time in the outdoors, you’ll want to bring the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunscreen</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby wipes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bug spray</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bandages</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the counter painkillers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antibiotic cream</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>#4 Weather Preparedness</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you're taking a summer road trip and the forecast says clear skies, you should take advantage of the fact you won't have to pay for extra luggage or overweight baggage fees and cover all your bases </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the long drive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If snow and ice seems completely ridiculous, just bring a warm coat, a rain jacket, and an umbrella. But if you’re going into a colder location, you may want to bring a mini snow shovel and ice scraper to keep in the car.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#5 Entertainment</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re wondering, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are fun things to take on a road trip? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re in luck, because fun is an essential part of every road trip. Traveling by car gives you a chance to connect with friends, family, and strangers, and take some time to yourself to relax and be introspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some ways to stay entertained during the drive:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Books (for reading and journaling)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Games or a deck of cards</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crafts like cross-stitching</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crossword or Sudoku books</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital camera (with charger)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disposable camera</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Finally, 4 Personal Road Trip Must Haves</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every experienced traveler knows that there’s an entire category of “essential items” that aren’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essential. Just try going on a weeklong road trip—even a week</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">end</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trip without these:</span></p>
<h3><strong>#1 A Playlist That’s At Least 4 Hours</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, there were mix tapes and CDs. Now, there are online playlists. Either way, music is a road trip essential… well, a road trip </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not-quite-essential</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> essential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add thirty minutes to your preparation time and build a playlist with all of your favorites from your past and present lives. Remind yourself of the angsty albums you used to listen to when you were in high school, alone in your room. Dance (safely) to the greatest hits of your senior year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relive your memories while creating new ones. That’s the beauty of a road trip.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#2 Reusable Water Bottle</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust us on this one, a reusable water bottle is one of the most essential </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">road trip must haves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When on a long stretch of road, a nature hike, and just about anywhere else, you'll want to stay hydrated. And constantly grabbing a tall Smart Water from the convenience store </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the gas station</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will quickly feel like a waste. Skip the guilt and say yes to hydration with a reusable bottle.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#3 Small Keepsake of Home</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever home means to you—you’ll be thinking about it after a few long days on the road. To avoid feeling homesick and wanting to make a U-turn, bring a small keepsake and stow it away for those desperate times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep it on the dashboard of your car or stuff it in your pillow for safe keeping. It doesn’t have to be anything big, it just has to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mean</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> something big.</span></p>
<h3><strong>#4 Eye Mask and Ear Plugs</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When on the road, you never know where you’re going to sleep. Maybe you’ve seen pictures of the hotel room or saw the campgrounds on Google Maps, but when it comes to your precious shut-eye, you want to make sure you’re prepared for everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s a light on outside your window that is glaring right in your eyes or if there’s a party going on at the next campsite—with an eye mask and set of ear plugs, you’ll be wandering off to dreamland without a care in the world.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How Should I Pack for a 2-Week Road Trip?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-carry-on-roller-black" target="_blank" title="black luggage" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/DSC00457_grande.png?v=1595605019" alt=""></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a long summer road trip ahead of you? Don’t worry, we’ve also got packing tips for an extra long car ride. Packing for 2 or 3 weeks on the road may seem overwhelming, but there’s one foolproof solution to packing for long trips: </span><a href="https://beistravel.com/products/the-packing-cubes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">packing cubes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What Are Packing Cubes?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren’t familiar with packing cubes, your whole life is about to change for the better. All you have to do is pick out a size of packing cube for all your shirts, another for all your pants, and so on. Then, you roll (yes, roll—don’t fold!) each type of clothing and store it in its very own packing cube, saving you space, keeping you organized, and leaving your clothes wrinkle-free.</span></p>

    <title>The Importance of Understanding Different Cultures</title>

      <![CDATA[<meta charset="utf-8">Understanding different cultures allows you to be more open, accepting, and tolerant of other people. Read on to discover more.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/the-importance-of-understanding-different-cultures">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>As societies become more intertwined on a global scale, countries’ demographics diversify, and our cross-cultural exchanges become more frequent. Our world is getting bigger, richer, and more culturally diverse. Understanding different cultures is more than having an appreciation for our differences, but paving the way for a new world where we all stand together.</p>
<p>We’re at a moment in time when we need to do more than tolerate each other. One of the reasons <a href="https://beistravel.com/blogs/news/10-reasons-why-traveling-is-important-for-everyone" title="why traveling is important for everyone">why traveling is important for everyone</a> is because it helps us become more inclusive and have a more well-rounded approach to the way we engage with other human beings. We need to form a global community that encourages mutual understanding, learning, and growing together.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Is It Important to Understand Different Cultures?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding different people and their cultures is one of the best ways we can learn from each other, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> learn more about ourselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what is culture? It boils down to this: culture is what informs our way of being—it’s what shapes our beliefs and values and influences our behaviors. For example, chugging a cup of coffee and a bagel on-the-go is unique to New York culture, while other countries and cultures—like in France and Japan—might strictly treat eating and walking as two separate activities. You engage in culture every day, in small ways and in big ones. </span></p>
<p>Culture is the shared language of a community, the holidays that are celebrated, and the religion that is practiced. It’s the recipes that are made, the material objects passed down through generations, and the ways we communicate with one another.</p>
<h2><strong>What Are the Benefits of Studying and Understanding Other Cultures?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivating a positive, accepting, culturally diverse society allows us to embrace multiculturalism and reevaluate old beliefs. We reflect on what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> see as normal or abnormal—like eating a bagel on the way to the Metro—and challenge ourselves to see the world from new perspectives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By studying and understanding new cultures, an important lesson becomes deeply ingrained in our minds—that we have nothing to gain from judging something or someone, we don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sociologists<sub>1 </sub></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> believe that multiculturalism is defined by the following actions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Recognizing</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that there are tons of different cultures and they’re all individually diverse</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Respecting</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the differences between one another</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Acknowledging</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the validity of different cultural backgrounds and expressions</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Valuing</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">what other cultures have to offer</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Encouraging</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">diverse groups to contribute to communities and public discourse</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Empowering</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">people to achieve their maximum potential by being critical of their own biases</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Celebrating</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one another, rather just tolerating our differences</span>
</li>
</ul>

<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://beistravel.com/collections/bags" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0032/3423/4479/files/1.png?v=1619029621" alt="shop BEIS bags" style="float: none;"></a></div>
<h2><strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What Can Different Cultures Teach Us?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By immersing ourselves in other cultures beyond our own, we can learn about each other—where people came from, what their traditions are, and what they struggle with as a community. It also forces us to criticize assumptions held about our own daily life and practices, encouraging incredible personal growth. Who knows, maybe you'll even learn something new about your own culture in the process. </span></p>
<p>There are plenty of ways you can start learning about other cultures, from asking your friends questions to reading up on various cultural norms online, but one of the best ways to truly grasp what a different culture is like is to put yourself at a culture’s epicenter—travel. Embracing different cultures through travel allows you to experience what it’s like to be a part of a community other than your own. It also gives you cultural awareness and acceptance, which can help break down cultural barriers while interacting with people of different backgrounds. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Here are some of the ways to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try a native language and dialect to achieve cultural competence—the ability to effectively interact with people across cultures. Even learning a few phrases and words can help you make deep connections with a culture different than your own! Learning a different language will also help you learn effective communication skills when speaking English with people who are not from the same cultural background as you.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join in on local celebrations with an open heart and an open mind.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cuisine <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">culture. Tap into your inner Anthony Bourdain and try the foods and drinks that locals are having.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Artistic expression can open up whole new doors to your understanding of a new culture. Visit art exhibits, performances, and history museums in the area.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid to ask questions, but make sure you’re being an active listener—it’s important to go out of your way to be respectful when someone is kind enough to open up and share their world or cultural values. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How Does Learning About Other Cultures Help Us Grow?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond gaining knowledge about a certain culture, you can become a better ally to a community you want to support by: </span> </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying new experiences outside your comfort zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the time to learn about different cultures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying those valuable skills into all other aspects of your life</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Increased Cultural Sensitivity</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about one culture is a lot like learning a different language—once you’ve done the work to understand and connect with one, it’s easier to learn about more. Increasing your cultural sensitivity about one culture helps you be more mindful of other cultures too, and may inspire you to learn more about different communities in the future. It also makes you want to be more open and share your culture with others who are interested. Win-win.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Reevaluating Biases</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-cultural experiences help you be more aware and cognizant of the way you act—from the things you think to the words you say, to the clothes you wear. But it doesn’t just make you rethink your own cultural biases. It also makes you question the root of where they came from—where do we subconsciously pick up learned behaviors and opinions that are culturally insensitive?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By normalizing the fact that you can change your opinions and allowing yourself to admit personal biases, you’ll start to recognize other groups of people for who they are—people just like you. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Becoming More Empathetic</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absorbing new information, seeing the world from different points of view, and practicing active listening skills are all humbling—and even joyful—acts that make you a more empathetic person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially in America, where demographic projections</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that diversity will continue to rise no matter what, even if immigration slows down, applying these new skills to life in the US is more important than ever.</span></p>
