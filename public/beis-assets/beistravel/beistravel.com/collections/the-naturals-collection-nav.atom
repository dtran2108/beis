The d-ring on each pouch can also be attached to the inside of any BÉIS bag, using our signature key fob (you can find this on interior seam of every BÉIS bag). Even better, the small snap card case comes with a scrunchie, take it for a spin on it's own and never have a reason you can't pull your hair back!</span>!</p>

This compact crossbody is the perfect bag to throw in your luggage for all your daytime excursions!

Oh, and it’s cute, because no one said to be a tourist you need to look like a tourist! </span></p>

Wait, not done yet - also includes a removable padded laptop sleeve with exterior pockets, to save you from that awkward moment when you hold up the security line. Easy-access opening makes getting everything in and out a breeze (no flashlight required). Hello, versatility!</p>
